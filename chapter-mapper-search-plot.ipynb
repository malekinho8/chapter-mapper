In recent years, data-driven<br>AD bloomed in various research fields, including smart devices [1],<br>robotics [2], manufacturing plants [3], aerospace instruments [4],<br>network monitoring [5], video surveillance [6] and so on.

A well-<br>recognized bottleneck for data-driven AD\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2022 - RoSAA Mechatronically Synthesized Dataset for Rot.pdf\",0,0,\"on. Such flourishment is strongly influenced by increasingly reduced<br>computing cost, and researchers\\u2019 access to unprecedented amount of<br>data. A well-recognized bottleneck for data-driven AD is the data<br>source [7]\\u2013[9]. Unlike image, text, and video datasets that are<br>abundant from daily human activities, AD datasets are constrained in<br>quantity and quality. Data-driven AD requires a vast amount of<br>historical and preferably anomalous data. However, it is challenging<br>to access data containing real anomalous events. Spontaneous anomalous<br>events are infrequent and difficult to capture. Synthetic anomalous<br>events are often uneconomical to conduct, difficult to sufficiently<br>scale up for data-driven purposes, and constrained by proprietary<br>concerns. Additionally, the unsupervised nature of many AD datasets<br>principally adds difficulty to develop high-performance AD models. In<br>general, AD studies input from open-source datasets. For this study,<br>time-series datasets are focused due to their extensive adoptions in<br>the field of AD research. Many large-scale repositories with<br>spontaneous-event datasets are used extensively [10]\\u2013[16]. Individual<br>datasets, such as [17]\\u2013[25], are also widely sourced for AD research.<br>In rare cases, researchers also synthesize their own datasets [2],<br>[3], [26], [27]. *This work was supported by The Japan Steel Works,<br>LTD., Japan 1 Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts<br>Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.

We detailedly<br>review the aforementioned datasets and repositories in Sec.II. In<br>short, spontaneous datasets face the limits of event diversity,<br>scaling, and labeling due to the nature of the anomaly. While<br>synthetic datasets suppose to be robust against these challenges<br>because the anomalous events are controlled, state-of-the-art (SOTA)<br>synthetic datasets still showcase room for improvement in these<br>aspects. Notably, the data-generation processes of existing synthetic<br>datasets are often heuristic and qualitative. The loss of plants\\u2019<br>theoretical models is another general shortcoming. It forces<br>researchers to adopt purely data-driven approaches.

II. RELATED WORK This section<br>first briefly reviews the data sources for AD research. The main body<br>consists of an extensive review of the synthetic datasets that are<br>widely used in previous AD literature. A. Data Source for AD Research<br>Diverse data sources are used for data-driven AD research. A<br>simplistic AD pipeline includes two phases: development and<br>deployment, i.e., an inference agent is trained in the first phase and<br>applied to a defined context in the second. Some studies emphasize the<br>AD deployment in specific domains. Researchers commonly synthesize<br>their own data in these domains to develop the AD agents so they can<br>be directly deployed. For example, a digital twin-based agent is<br>developed in [3] using 15-days\\u2019 of historical data of an industrial<br>chiller.

Generally, these synthetic datasets are constrained from<br>public access. For AD agents that aim to generalize to extensive<br>deployment domains, open-source datasets are widely-used. Typically,<br>the agent is designed for inputs with a specific structure and<br>deployed on one or multiple similar datasets to benchmark its<br>performance. Open-source datasets are good benchmarks to evaluate AD<br>agents\\u2019 performances because of their popular utilities: the ECG and<br>space shuttle datasets in [10] are utilized in multiple studies over<br>decades to develop inference agents [29]\\u2013[31]; the CWRU dataset [20]<br>is used as a standard reference to authenticate time-series AD models<br>in dozens of previous studies [32]. Besides, open-source time-series<br>repositories with spontaneous-event datasets also have significant<br>utilities in the AD community: \\u2022 UCI: 126 labeled multi/uni-variate<br>datasets [10] \\u2022 UCR: 128 labeled uni-variate datasets [11] \\u2022 UEA: 30<br>labeled multi-variate datasets [12] \\u2022 NASA PCoE: 17 labeled multi-<br>variate datasets [13] \\u2022 NAB: Benchmark + 7 labeled multi-variate<br>datasets [14] \\u2022 SKAB: Benchmark + 1 labeled multi-variate dataset [15]<br>\\u2022 UADB: 10 unlabeled multi/uni-variate datasets [16] Spontaneous<br>anomalous-event datasets are naturally rare and unstructured.

Despite the<br>considerable scale of the aforementioned repositories [10]\\u2013[16], the<br>majority of datasets within them are not principally intended for AD<br>purposes but for generic time-series classification, such as<br>classifying days of a week or event locations. Aside from these<br>datasets, only a handful of datasets contain spontaneously anomalous<br>events. Nonetheless, these datasets are unideal for data-driven usages<br>due to their constrained scale and supervision: [33] contains six<br>sequences of data for worn and new cutting blades; [14] contains<br>several unsupervised datasets of real-world network device usage, with<br>each dataset consisting of less than 20 sequences. As a result,<br>synthetic datasets are the dominating sources for data-driven AD<br>research. B. Properties of Synthetic Datasets for AD Research Many<br>synthetic datasets have been proposed previously, and a unified<br>framework is needed to homogenize their nomenclatures. We<br>conceptualize condition state synthesis, involving three elements: a<br>plant, a condition state synthesis (CSS) agent, and a data acquisition<br>(DAQ) agent. The plant is the subject of the synthesis, and its<br>condition state space embodies all possible health conditions of the<br>plant. The term condition state frequently manifests as event, mode,<br>condition, or configuration in previous literature. The CSS agent<br>operates the plant such that various condition states are reached. The<br>DAQ agent compiles two streams of signals to a labeled data sequence:<br>(1) the ground truth condition state labels available from the CSS<br>agent; (2) the observation-space sensor signals that objectively<br>measure the condition states.\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2022 - RoSAA Mechatronically Synthesized Dataset for Rot.pdf\",0,1,\"data sequence: (1) the ground truth condition state labels available<br>from the CSS agent; (2) the observation-space sensor signals that<br>objectively measure the condition states. Typically, one synthetic<br>runtime generates one data sequence, and a dataset contains hundreds<br>of runtimes and sequences. The above framework is generalizable to the<br>data generation processes of most synthetic datasets, including the<br>proprietary ones [2], [3], [27]. Under this framework, a review of<br>past synthetic datasets is presented. In general, SOTA synthetic<br>datasets have the following five features: (1) Qualitative condition<br>space. For example, the condition space in the [15] dataset includes:<br>valve closed at the outlet and inlet of a pump, water supply increases<br>volume and temperature, rotor imbalance, and others. Despite being<br>intuitive, the states are loosely defined and are potentially strongly<br>correlated, which could prevent the development of strong AD decision<br>boundaries. Additionally, AD performance might be constrained in<br>generalizability because the condition space is specific to the plant.<br>(2) Time-invariant (TI) and run-to-fail (RTF) runtimes. Many synthetic<br>datasets do not consider state transitions of the plant within a<br>single runtime. We define it as a time-invariant runtime. To generate<br>every data sequence in the CWRU dataset, a ball bearing with a<br>specific anomalous configuration is used in a rotary system [20].<br>Likewise, [34] captures signals of a theoretical engine model running<br>with a different setting for each runtime. A TI synthetic runtime<br>corresponds to a grid-search node in the condition state space, and<br>intermittent setups are needed to transit between states.<br>Consequently, the plant\\u2019s behaviors\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2022 - RoSAA Mechatronically Synthesized Dataset for Rot.pdf\",0,1,\"synthetic runtime corresponds to a grid-search node in the condition<br>state space, and intermittent setups are needed to transit between<br>states. Consequently, the plant\\u2019s behaviors during state transitions<br>are lost, and the synthetic process is inefficient, preventing the<br>dataset from scaling up. In contrast, time-variant (TV) runtimes,<br>during which the plant\\u2019s condition states vary, can accelerate the<br>synthetic process and enrich the dataset\\u2019s information. However, only<br>run-to-failure runtimes are available in previous literature [23],<br>[35]. A RTF runtime is a type of TV runtimes, during which the state<br>of a plant transits from normal when it is freshly installed to<br>abnormal when it fails at the end of the runtime, leaving the<br>intermediate states difficult to quantify. In addition, the state<br>transitions are unwindable, which also limits the efficiency of RTF<br>runtimes. (3) Per-sequence condition state labels. Due to the<br>expensive annotation process and lack of controlled state transitions,<br>in all existing literature, each data sequence is annotated with at<br>most one label, i.e., an anomalous configuration for TI syntheses, or<br>a failure mode for RTF syntheses. This type of per-sequence condition<br>state label is too sparse to embody shortterm behavior, which is<br>critical to real-time AD development. (4) Component-level plants.<br>There is a misalignment between plants used in synthetic datasets and<br>real-world systems. While the former focus on single components,<br>including ball bearings [20], [23], [24], cutting blades [33], valves<br>[15] and so on, the latter consists of multiple components. The root<br>cause is that anomalous states on system-level plants are costly\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2022 - RoSAA Mechatronically Synthesized Dataset for Rot.pdf\",0,1,\"blades [33], valves [15] and so on, the latter consists of multiple<br>components. The root cause is that anomalous states on system-level<br>plants are costly and risky to synthesize. Datasets in the digital<br>domain are naturally less constrained. Aside from [34] reviewed<br>previously, [21] constructs a digital model of a turbofan plant to<br>generate RTF data. The fidelities of digital syntheses are significant<br>concerns because the models can accidentally fall under the curse of<br>over-simplification, such as neglecting multi-physics interaction.<br>Ideally, a physical-domain system-level plant prohibits the sim-to-<br>real gap between the digital and physical domains, and ameliorates the<br>limited generalizability faced by componentlevel plants; (5) Loss of<br>physical information. Most datasets are organized without a<br>mathematical description of the plant. Thus their only utilities are<br>data-driven. At best, a few datasets, such as [20], [21], [35],<br>provide qualitative descriptions of their plants and sensors. Real-<br>world plants follow laws of physics described by differential<br>equations, and studies demonstrate that leveraging physical<br>information enhances the performance of AD methods [36]. Despite the<br>wide utility of the above datasets, their synthetic processes and<br>inherent properties showcase rooms for improvement. 2643 Authorized<br>licensed use limited to: MIT Libraries.

The generalized forces<br>(Q) are excellent candidates with the following remarks: (1) external<br>norms or anomalies of the plant affect the rotodynamic system as<br>generalized forces, regardless of the actual form they manifest; (2)<br>they are fully controllable for rotodynamic systems with proper<br>instruments; (3) they are naturally quantitative; (4) they are<br>parametric in the theoretical models and are agnostic to the modeling<br>method. With the generalized forces as the foundation of the condition<br>state space, redundancies are removed, and necessary additions are<br>determined. There are four generalized forces: shear and axial forces,<br>and bending and torsional moments (torque). Bending moments and shear<br>force are assumed redundant in the condition state space. Bending<br>moments are mostly resultants of shear loads in practice instead of<br>stand-alone. The two are analytically interchangeable except for very<br>complex loading and boundary conditions.

We propose the usage of lateral vibrations to<br>abstract the internal anomalies because, in practice, lateral<br>vibrations are the main manifestations of most rotodynamic<br>configuration faults [37]. In summary, three variables are candidates:<br>the shear load (Fxy), the lateral vibration frequency (\\u03c9xy), and the<br>torque (Tz). We propose to use their residuals from the normal<br>operation as the condition state variables: s={[s1,s2,s3]T<br>\\u2208S|s1\\u2208R\\u2229[0,\\u02dcFxy,ub]; s2\\u2208Z\\u2229[0,\\u02dc\\u03c9xy,ub];s3\\u2208R\\u2229[0,\\u02dcTz,ub]} (9) with ub<br>denoting upper bound. Ideally, the plant operates normally if and only<br>if \\u2225s\\u2225=0. Practically, a threshold st,k is applied to every state<br>variable to determine if plant\\u2019s health condition is normal: sk \\u2264st,k<br>\\u2200k\\u2208{1,2,3} (10) D. State-Transition Model Existing AD datasets\\u2019<br>synthetic processes are not planned systematically, resulting in<br>constrained efficiencies and lack of controllable state transitions.<br>Regularly, the synthetic process exhausts the condition state space<br>with brute force by initializing the plant with a specific condition<br>state for each runtime. This initial state is held constant throughout<br>a TI synthetic runtime, and it propagates from norm to failure without<br>external control input during a RTF synthetic runtime. We propose the<br>first method to parametrically model and plan controlled condition<br>state syntheses. The model assumes a time-variant synthetic runtime,<br>during which state transitions are actively carried out. A Markov<br>Chain is designed as the underlying state-transition model. The three<br>condition state variables in Eqn.(9) are assumed to transit<br>independently. As demonstrated in Fig.3, for every synthetic runtime,<br>the plant propagates through n condition states, recorded as condition<br>state sequence S = {s(1),s(2),...,s(n)} where s \\u2208\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2022 - RoSAA Mechatronically Synthesized Dataset for Rot.pdf\",0,3,\"demonstrated in Fig.3, for every synthetic runtime, the plant<br>propagates through n condition states, recorded as condition state<br>sequence S = {s(1),s(2),...,s(n)} where s \\u2208 S. For every dimension k<br>\\u2208{1,2,3} in the condition state space, the Markov model is defined<br>with two parameters, \\u0398k = {\\u03c0k,Ak}, where \\u03c0k is the initial<br>distribution, and Ak is a \\u2225Sk\\u2225\\u00d7\\u2225Sk\\u2225 transition probability matrix<br>between attributes i,j\\u2208Sk: \\u03c0k(i)=P \\ufffd sk(1)=i \\ufffd s.t. \\ufffd i \\u03c0k(i)=1 (11)<br>Ak(i,j)=P \\ufffd sk(n)=j|sk(n\\u22121)=i \\ufffd (12) with Sk is the space where the<br>condition state variable sk resides. Leveraging a Markov Chain as the<br>state-transition model is tangibly beneficial because it directly<br>nests into a Hidden Markov Model framework. Illustrated in Fig.3, as<br>inputs Qn are exerted on a plant whose condition state propagates, an<br>objective observation vector, o, is made by the DAQ agent. Assuming<br>that sampling rate of the observer is c times higher than the state-<br>transition rate, then for a synthetic runtime S, the observation<br>sequence O = {o(1),o(2),...,o(c\\u00b7n)} are made.

SYNTHESIS EXECUTION AND DATASET This<br>section presents the synthesis execution process and the Rotodynamic<br>System with Synthetic Anomaly dataset. A. Synthesis Executor Overview<br>To execute the designed synthesis, a mechatronics apparatus in [28],<br>[38] is utilized. As depicted in Fig.4-A, the apparatus contains a<br>rotodynamic plant, including a rotary shaft driven by a DC motor with<br>normal torque inputs. The shaft is supported by modularly configurable<br>hardware. Two sets of automated devices are developed to explore the<br>plant\\u2019s condition state space, including an axial condition state<br>synthesis agent in Fig.4-C, and a lateral one in Fig.4-D. A B C D Fig.<br>4. Synthesis execution apparatus: A. Rotodynamic plant; B. Onboard DAQ<br>system; C. Axial\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2022 - RoSAA Mechatronically Synthesized Dataset for Rot.pdf\",0,4,\"Fig.4-C, and a lateral one in Fig.4-D. A B C D Fig. 4. Synthesis<br>execution apparatus: A. Rotodynamic plant; B. Onboard DAQ system; C.<br>Axial CSS agent; D. Lateral CSS agent. The condition state synthesis<br>agents introduces an external shear load to the rotary plant (N-mode),<br>excite lateral vibration at a commanded frequency (V-mode), and exerts<br>a residual torque to the plant (D-mode). All three modes are carried<br>out with an open-loop reference and measured. The N-mode and V-mode<br>syntheses directly adopt the proposed condition state space in<br>Eqn.(9). The axial CSS agent mainly consists of a coaxial motor. For<br>the D-mode synthesis, it exerts an extra torque on the plant that<br>mimics an external damping behavior: \\u02c6Tz =\\u2212K2 R \\u03a9 (13) where K and R<br>are the motor constant and internal resistance of the coaxial motor,<br>respectively. Instead of commanding \\u02c6Tz, the axial CSS agent<br>manipulates and records R, such that the dependency of \\u02c6Tz on \\u03a9 is<br>removed. Therefore, the implemented condition state variables, s\\u2032<br>follows: s\\u2032={[s1,s2,s3]T \\u2208S\\u2032|s1\\u2208R\\u2229[0,\\u02dcFxy,ub];<br>s2\\u2208Z\\u2229[0,\\u02dc\\u03c9xy,ub];s3:=Rd\\u2212R;R\\u2208Z\\u2229[Rlb,Rub]} (14) where Rd is the coaxial<br>motor\\u2019s desired resistance, and Rlb is the minimum resistance. The<br>following configurations are used to generate the RoSA dataset: (1)<br>the condition state space is defined with: \\u02dcFxy,ub = 15N, \\u02dc\\u03c9xy,ub =<br>25Hz,Rd = Rub = 15k\\u03a9,Rlb = 1k\\u03a9; (2) the condition state transitions<br>are scheduled to take place at f =1Hz; (3) the CSS agent controls the<br>condition state transitions with: \\u03c0k(i)=\\u2225Sk\\u2225\\u22121,Ak(i,j)= \\ufffd 0.9 \\u2200i=j<br>0.1\\u00b7(\\u2225Sk\\u2225\\u22121)\\u22121 \\u2200i\\u0338=j (4) the CSS agents samples the state variables at<br>fcss \\u224870Hz;\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2022 - RoSAA Mechatronically Synthesized Dataset for Rot.pdf\",0,4,\"CSS agent controls the condition state transitions with:<br>\\u03c0k(i)=\\u2225Sk\\u2225\\u22121,Ak(i,j)= \\ufffd 0.9 \\u2200i=j 0.1\\u00b7(\\u2225Sk\\u2225\\u22121)\\u22121 \\u2200i\\u0338=j (4) the CSS<br>agents samples the state variables at fcss \\u224870Hz; (5) the DAQ agent<br>makes R23 observations and records the sampled ground truth condition<br>states at the same rate, fdaq =fcss; (6) the DAQ agent preprocesses<br>condition states with class labels following st,1=0.05,st,2=st,3=0;<br>(7) the DAQ sensors\\u2019 attributes and alignments, and hardware<br>components and are detailed in [28]. B. Rotodynamic System with<br>Synthetic Anomaly Dataset The resulting RoSA dataset contains the<br>following information and is advantageous in several aspects: (1) 235<br>synthetic runtimes are conducted, corresponding to 235 data sequences<br>in the RoSA dataset. A total of 386272 time steps, approximately 5775<br>seconds of data are collected. This scale is the largest for AD usage,<br>more than twice of the popular [20] data archive; (2) Along the time<br>horizon, 3400 seconds corresponds to the plants\\u2019 normal operation. The<br>dataset contains diverse and frequent anomalous states in the 2375<br>seconds left, including 1650, 1010, 705 seconds of the plant<br>undergoing N, V, D-mode syntheses, respectively. More than 100, 422,<br>and 95 state transitions are actively carried out for the three modes.<br>The abundance of anomalous condition recording and controlled<br>condition state transitions are unprecedented from past AD datasets;<br>(3) The dataset contains short-term Fig. 5.

This resource is unique and<br>practically beneficial for AD model development, and its use cases are<br>further discussed in Sec.V; (4) Though trivially technical, the<br>dataset currently embodies R23 observation dimension, the highest<br>compared to existing literature; (5) When necessary, the dataset can<br>scale up rapidly with the proposed systematic synthesis method and<br>automated synthesis executor. The current material takes less than a<br>week to synthesize and compile. A synthetic data sequence in the RoSA<br>dataset is visualized in Fig.5. In period A, the plant warms up to the<br>commanded rotation speed \\u03a9=200RPM. During period B, the CSS agent<br>exerts an shear load open-loop-referenced at 7.5N to the shaft. The<br>V-mode Markovian synthesis is automatically carried out over period C,<br>during which a series of controlled lateral vibration frequencies are<br>injected into the shaft consecutively. In periods D and E, the CSS<br>agent and the plant reset to idle, respectively. All the ground truth<br>condition states are cleanly recorded in Fig.5. V. CASE STUDY A<br>learning-based AD case study is conducted with the RoSA dataset. The<br>case aims to highlight the unique and beneficial utilities of the<br>dataset on AD research. There are two general AD approaches for time-<br>series data. The first approach is observation-oriented. Denoted as<br>O-Model, the learning model uses observation vectors from the past nw<br>time steps to predict\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2022 - RoSAA Mechatronically Synthesized Dataset for Rot.pdf\",0,5,\"for time-series data. The first approach is observation-oriented.<br>Denoted as O-Model, the learning model uses observation vectors from<br>the past nw time steps to predict the incoming observation:<br>\\u02c6o(n+1)=O-Model \\ufffd o(n),o(n\\u22121),..,o(n\\u2212nw) \\ufffd (15) This model is<br>abbreviated as O-Modelnw for the following. This type of self-<br>supervised setup is commonly applied for generic time-series scenarios<br>when an accurate prediction of the future observations is important<br>while an inference of the unobservable state variables is unnecessary,<br>such as stock price prediction. In contrast, the inference of the<br>condition state variables is the core for AD application. Thus, a<br>decision criteria \\u03b3(\\u00b7) is applied to map the predicted observation to<br>a condition state inference. Regularly, this criterion is based on the<br>mean-squared-error (MSE) between the predicted and actual<br>observations: \\u02c6s(n+1)= \\ufffd A, if MSE \\ufffd o(n+1),\\u02c6o(n+1) \\ufffd >dt H, if MSE \\ufffd<br>o(n+1),\\u02c6o(n+1) \\ufffd \\u2264dt where dt is a scalar threshold; H,A are the<br>binary annotation of the healthy and anomalous condition state,<br>respectively. A significant challenge with the observation-oriented<br>approach is that systematic evaluation the model performance is<br>difficult because the ground truth knowledge of the incoming condition<br>state, s(n+1), is not available from existing datasets. The second<br>method is condition-state-oriented. Denoted as S-Model, such learning<br>models are trained with ground truth condition states as labels and<br>predict future condition states directly. This ideality is similar to<br>Eqn.(15): \\u02c6s(n+1)=S-Model \\ufffd o(n),o(n\\u22121),..,o(n\\u2212nw) \\ufffd (16)<br>Unfortunately, although many reviewed AD datasets contain ground truth<br>state labels, all existing labels are at per-sequence granularity. In<br>reality, the trained learning models at\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2022 - RoSAA Mechatronically Synthesized Dataset for Rot.pdf\",0,5,\"Unfortunately, although many reviewed AD datasets contain ground truth<br>state labels, all existing labels are at per-sequence granularity. In<br>reality, the trained learning models at best infer at a per-sequence<br>frequency as well: \\u02c6s(seq)=S-Model(seq) (17) While their per-sequence<br>long-term predictions may be accurate, such models are not expected to<br>provide short-term and timely predictions, which is fundamental to<br>real-world AD applications. Learning-based AD models are developed<br>with the RoSA dataset to demonstrate that its unique features can<br>ameliorate the above technical challenges. The three practically<br>beneficial features are large-scale, diverse, and frequent anomalous<br>condition states, and per-time-step condition state labels. Without<br>loss of generality, a Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) architecture is<br>used as the foundation of the learning model. LSTM is a successful<br>architecture for sequential input prediction in recent years. The<br>working principle of LSTM is formalized in [39] and is not reiterated<br>in this study. Both orientation-based version, O-LSTMnw, and<br>condition-state-based one, S-LSTMnw, are developed. The two versions<br>share the basic structure: each LSTM layer contains nw unit cells;<br>each cell further contains 50 hidden neurons; a ReLU activation<br>function is applied to the LSTM layer; a fully-connected (FC) layer is<br>stacked at the output of the LSTM layer. The O-LSTMnw predicts the<br>incoming R23 observation vector, so a Tanh activation function and an<br>MSE loss are used at the final output of the FC layer. The S-LSTMnw is<br>trained with RoSA\\u2019s unique per-time-step states as binary labels.<br>Consequently, a Sigmoid activation function and a cross-entropy loss<br>are applied. The training setup is detailed below. Every\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2022 - RoSAA Mechatronically Synthesized Dataset for Rot.pdf\",0,5,\"RoSA\\u2019s unique per-time-step states as binary labels. Consequently, a<br>Sigmoid activation function and a cross-entropy loss are applied. The<br>training setup is detailed below. Every learning model is batch-<br>trained with 200 epochs and the batch size set at 64. The learning<br>rate starts at 0.01, and a 5% decay is applied for every epoch after<br>the tenth. Excluding the complete sequence in Fig.5, 40960 {input<br>(Rnw\\u00d723), output} data pairs are uniformly sampled from the RoSA<br>dataset to form the training set; 7500 for validation; and 10000 for<br>testing. This scale of training data is significant from an AD<br>perspective. The RoSA dataset contains diverse condition state. The<br>normal against anomalous data pairs are approximately 55%:45%, which<br>practically solves the distribution-imbalance problem, a major concern<br>in AD research. All numeric signals are normalized, and all<br>categorical signals are encoded before being fed into the learning<br>models. In this study, models with horizon nw<br>=[10,20,40,60,80,100,200,400,800] are developed for analysis. The<br>training process is conducted with Keras, and all O-LSTM and S-LSTM<br>models converge to reasonable trained results.

The outcomes of this work elucidate the heat transfer physics<br>governing individual droplet growth during vapor condensation on both<br>hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces that can be extended to the<br>study of droplet-basal contact resistance on microstructured surfaces,<br>droplet evaporation, and droplet freezing processes. \\u25a0 RESULTS AND<br>DISCUSSION Model Development. To study the individual droplet heat<br>transfer process of noncoalescing droplets, a 2D axisymmetric<br>numerical model based on the \\ufb01nite element method was used to solve<br>the heat equation through a single droplet (see Supporting<br>Information, section S1). Although the droplet heat transfer process<br>during condensation is exceedingly complex, some simplifying<br>assumptions are possible from realizing that most of the heat is<br>transferred through droplets of diameter less than 100 \\u03bcm.37,56 For<br>such small droplets the in\\ufb02uence of gravity on the droplet shape is<br>negligible and a sphericalsegment geometry may be assumed (Figure 1).<br>In addition, Marangoni and buoyant convection are neglected since the<br>droplets are su\\ufb03ciently small so that conduction is the dominant mode<br>of heat transfer.57,58 Furthermore, the heat transfer and droplet<br>growth are quasi-steady processes governed by the steady heat-<br>conduction equation, ensuring that an analytic formulation can be<br>completed with various boundary conditions.53 To reconcile the<br>discontinuity associated with a constant free surface temperature, we<br>assume a constant heat transfer coe\\ufb03cient boundary condition at the<br>liquid\\u2212vapor interface (hi), and a constant temperature (Ts) boundary<br>condition at the solid\\u2212liquid interface (Figure 1). Thus,\"],[\"Chavan et al. - 2016 - Heat Transfer through a Condensate Droplet on Hydr.pdf\",0,1,\"constant heat transfer coe\\ufb03cient boundary condition at the<br>liquid\\u2212vapor interface (hi), and a constant temperature (Ts) boundary<br>condition at the solid\\u2212liquid interface (Figure 1). Thus, there is no<br>sudden temperature jump (discontinuity) across the three phase contact<br>line, and the temperature will change gradually along the liquid\\u2212vapor<br>interface. The liquid\\u2212 vapor interface heat transfer coe\\ufb03cient is<br>given by the interfacial condensation heat transfer coe\\ufb03cient, hi:59 \\u03b1<br>\\u03b1 \\u03c0 \\u03bd = \\u2212 h R T h T 22 21 i g sat fg 2 g sat (1) where Rg is the<br>speci\\ufb01c gas constant and \\u03bdg is the water vapor speci\\ufb01c volume, Tsat is<br>the water vapor saturation temperature, and hfg is the latent heat of<br>condensation phase change. Since it is widely accepted that hi is<br>independent of the interface location, we henceforth consider hi as<br>constant along the liquid\\u2212vapor interface.52 The condensation<br>coe\\ufb03cient \\u03b1 is the ratio of vapor molecules that will be captured by<br>the liquid phase to the total number of vapor molecules reaching the<br>liquid surface (ranging from 0 to 1). To study the e\\ufb00ect of<br>condensation coe\\ufb03cient on heat transfer, the model was simulated for<br>di\\ufb00erent values of \\u03b1 (0.01, 0.04, and 1), representing both<br>contaminated (\\u03b1 = 0.01) and clean (\\u03b1 = 1) environments.52 The<br>condensate droplet is assumed to have a constant apparent advancing<br>contact angle (\\u03b8a).

The change from copper (\\u223c800 nm) to<br>aluminum-based nanostructures (\\u223c300 nm) does not alter the growth<br>dynamics of condensing droplets due to the negligible thermal<br>resistance of the partially wetted base for both surfaces. Smooth<br>hydrophobic silicon was used instead of tool \\ufb01nish copper because of<br>our desire to observe droplet growth behavior on lower advancing<br>contact angle surfaces to investigate the robustness of our numerical<br>model. To create superhydrophobic aluminum oxide samples, the<br>technique given by ref 75 was used. Commercially available Al tabs (10<br>mm \\u00d7 10 mm \\u00d7 0.8 mm) were used (99.90% purity).

This process allows for the development of a highly<br>conformal coating as the HTMS molecules evaporate from solution and<br>redeposit on the aluminum samples. The same technique was used to coat<br>HTMS on smooth silicon wafers, which were cleaned with acetone, IPA,<br>DI water, and rinsed in clean N2 prior to functionalization.

The experimentally obtained droplet diameter as a<br>function of time for superhydrophobic and hydrophobic morphologies are<br>shown in Figure 9c,d, respectively. On superhydrophobic aluminum,<br>scatter in the droplet growth data was almost nonexistent, with<br>droplets growing, coalescing, jumping, and regrowing in a self-similar<br>manner for each cycle. In addition, the droplet growth rate of<br>adjacent droplets was also identical in nature. The lower variability<br>in growth rate is attributed to the lack of NCGs in the ESEM<br>environment. The vapor di\\ufb00usion resistance is\"],[\"Chavan et al. - 2016 - Heat Transfer through a Condensate Droplet on Hydr.pdf\",0,9,\"identical in nature. The lower variability in growth rate is<br>attributed to the lack of NCGs in the ESEM environment. The vapor<br>di\\ufb00usion resistance is much smaller, and hence, droplet growth<br>dynamics are limited mainly by interfacial resistance at early times,<br>and conduction resistance at later times. To provide insight into the<br>ESEM results and verify our simulations, we modeled the experimental<br>droplet growth behavior with the numerical and analytical models<br>according to eq 12. The results of the numerical model (black dashed<br>line) are shown in Figure 9c,d and are in excellent agreement with the<br>experiments. The removal of NCGs acted to accentuate the growth rate<br>di\\ufb00erence between the two droplet morphologies. As observed in the<br>experiments, the numerical model shows that for large diameters (D ><br>20 \\u03bcm), droplets growing on the superhydrophobic surface have lower<br>growth rates (d\\u27e8D\\u27e9/dt = 0.06 \\u03bcm/s) than droplets on the hydrophobic<br>surface (d\\u27e8D\\u27e9/dt = 0.2 \\u03bcm/s) due to the added conduction thermal<br>resistance. While at low diameters (D < 20 \\u03bcm), the growth rate of the<br>superhydrophobic droplets (d\\u27e8D\\u27e9/dt = 1.0 \\u03bcm/s) is much faster due to<br>interfacial thermal resistance dominated growth. These same trends<br>were observed in the optical microscopy results, however with lower<br>growth rate di\\ufb00erence between the two droplet morphologies arising<br>from (1) the higher advancing contact angle of the tool-\\ufb01nish copper<br>surface, and (2) the external vapor di\\ufb00usion resistance, which acted<br>to minimize growth di\\ufb00erences due to morphology.

The value used in the<br>numerical model is within the error of the experimental apparatus. It<br>is important to note that for the smooth hydrophobic silicon surface<br>(Figure 9b,d), the ESEM model solutions were obtained for surface-to-<br>vapor temperature di\\ufb00erence \\u0394T = 0.004 \\u00b0C, which was di\\ufb00erent from the<br>superhydrophobic solution (\\u0394T = 0.01 \\u00b0C), and also within the error of<br>the experimental apparatus. The model \\u0394T values for superhydrophobic<br>and hydrophobic surfaces did not match because the experiments were<br>not done at the same time. Unlike the optical microscopy experiments,<br>in which biphilic samples were used and observed simultaneously, the<br>ESEM results were obtained with di\\ufb00erent samples and individual runs<br>for each sample, leading to di\\ufb00erent local supersaturations depending<br>on the viewing location, viewing angle, and beam conditions, and hence<br>di\\ufb00erent \\u0394T.

The droplet<br>growth experiments shown here not only validate the developed<br>numerical model of condensation on hydrophobic and superhydrophobic<br>surfaces, they reinforce the picture that future high \\ufb01delity studies<br>of droplet growth must take into account the NCG content of the<br>saturated vapor.

Unlike previous works, which utilize<br>constant temperature boundary conditions and shape factor<br>approximations, our work resolves the full droplet temperature and<br>heat \\ufb02ux distribution, showing that the interfacial temperature does<br>indeed vary at the free surface, and that local heat transfer at the<br>three phase contact line can be 4 orders of magnitude higher when<br>compared to the droplet top. We computed the droplet Nusselt number<br>and e\\ufb00ective thermal resistance, showing discrepancies between our<br>results and previous models at higher droplet radii due to the<br>elevated droplet conduction resistance imposed by previous models.<br>Through the integration of our model results and droplet distribution<br>theory, we demonstrated that the currently accepted shape-factor based<br>analytical models tend to underestimate heat transfer by as much as<br>300%, due to their inability to resolve heat transport at the three<br>phase contact line.

The dynamic<br>anomaly generator is configured to generate at least one  anomaly in<br>the rotatable shaft while the rotatable shaft is  rotating , and is<br>configured to generate at least one dynamic  label for each anomaly<br>while the rotatable shaft is rotating .  The dynamic label for each<br>anomaly includes at least one  descriptor corresponding to the anomaly<br>that describes the  anomaly such that a machine learning method may<br>utilize  the descriptor for machine learning .

FIELD  [ 0002 ] The present<br>disclosure is directed to data synthe  sizers for rotary plants , and<br>more particularly relates to  dynamic anomaly generators capable of<br>processing and  labeling anomalies in a more efficient manner  .<br>BACKGROUND  a  [ 0005 ]  In particular , real world anomalous data<br>sets on  physical machines are rare , due , at least in part , to the<br>expense from constantly monitoring anomalous events that  sparsely<br>take place . Further , real world anomalous data sets  on physical<br>machines are often unlabeled , owing , at least in  part , to the<br>difficulty in quantifying the anomalous actions  and recording their<br>time lines .  [ 0006 ]  Unsupervised learning methods are similar to<br>model free applications , while supervised learning methods  incline<br>to the anomaly detection end alerts broadcast when  ever incoming<br>signals map to a specific type of learned  anomalies . The performance<br>of data driven AD & HM meth  ods is often limited due to several<br>qualities in existing  training datasets . As determined in<br>conjunction with arriving  at the concepts disclosed herein , at least<br>the following  attributes can be improved to create an enhanced<br>anomaly  dataset : frequent anomaly ( FA )\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2022 - Modular, general purpose, automated, anomalous dat.pdf\",0,20,\"disclosed herein , at least the following  attributes can be improved<br>to create an enhanced anomaly  dataset : frequent anomaly ( FA ) ,<br>which can improve data  efficiency ; automated anomaly ( AA ) , which<br>can scale up  dataset volume ; reproducible anomaly ( RA ) , which can<br>improve model fidelity ; supervised anomaly label ( Sp ) ,  which can<br>alter training process , model agnostic process  ( MA  ) , which can<br>better represent reality ; diverse anomaly  modes ( DM  ) , which can<br>ameliorate covariate shift ; and  high dimensional observer ( Ob ) ,<br>which can enrich informa  tion gain .  [ 0007 ] Given that many<br>anomaly datasets are artificially  simulated , model agnosticism<br>describes the extent to which  a faulty synthetic event is independent<br>of ideal assumptions ,  for example , the vehicle collision models<br>used in game  engines . This characteristic arises from the concern<br>that  synthetic anomalies in the physical and cyber domains either<br>overly simplify the argument to retain fruitful results or are<br>exceedingly complex to construct . On the other hand , natu  ral<br>anomalies are often detrimental to reproduce , impractical  to capture<br>accurately , or constrained to disclose .  [ 0008 ] A popular<br>alternative is to synthesize anomalous  data on a benchtop test plant<br>. As illustrated in FIG  . 1\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2022 - Modular, general purpose, automated, anomalous dat.pdf\",0,20,\"[ 0008 ] A popular alternative is to synthesize anomalous  data on a<br>benchtop test plant . As illustrated in FIG  . 1 , the  general data<br>synthesis process involves the following steps :  input variables<br>UERnxl are fed into a physical plant , in  normal or anomalous<br>condition , and the states XERmxl  updated , which are measured via a<br>sensor system and  produces YERpxl signals .  [ 0009 ]  Existing<br>anomaly synthesizers are disadvantageous  in at least a few aspects .<br>For example , being limited to  introducing only static anomalies is a<br>significant short  coming . Static anomalies normally include<br>replacing quality  parts with defected ones or operating under bad<br>service  conditions . The anomalous plant , G? , varies between runs ,<br>but is time invariant or negligibly variant during each run .<br>Impulsive anomaly synthesizers are occasionally developed ,  but a<br>synthesizer for generic dynamic anomalies ( also  referred to as time<br>varying anomalies ) is lacking , and inevi  tably , so is labelling<br>the synthesized anomalies in time  series . By way of further example<br>, uni modality of anoma  lous events is another major inconvenience .<br>Most existing  synthesizer test beds are developed for a single type<br>of  anomaly . Even on the same subject , researchers have to  develop<br>new sets of devices to introduce anomalies of other  types\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2022 - Modular, general purpose, automated, anomalous dat.pdf\",0,20,\" anomaly . Even on the same subject , researchers have to  develop new<br>sets of devices to introduce anomalies of other  types . From the data<br>acquisition perspective , measurements  in available anomalous data<br>sets are often univariate or  multi variate with low dimensions .<br>Access to multi variate  measurements on the same anomalous event can<br>be tangibly  useful for data driven studies .  [ 0003 ] Anomalies<br>represent outliers in a set of data , which  may be indicative of a<br>potential problem with a particular  system . In the context of a<br>machine , such as a rotary plant ,  anomaly detection can provide<br>important feedback to an  operator to identify potential<br>inefficiencies or points of  failure . In fact , anomaly detection and<br>health monitoring  ( AD & HM  ) are core concerns for most engineering<br>applica  tions . Health monitoring is a critical aspect for both<br>physical  and virtual machines , spanning from manufacturing plant<br>monitoring to cyber safety detection . Since the last century ,<br>diagnosis of past anomalous events and prognosis for future  anomalies<br>have been trending topics . Especially with the  rapid advancement of<br>computing power in recent years ,  data driven anomaly analysis is<br>gaining popularity , in place  of traditional methods that utilize<br>model based analysis of  real plants . Anomalous scenarios on a rotary<br>plant source\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2022 - Modular, general purpose, automated, anomalous dat.pdf\",0,20,\", in place  of traditional methods that utilize model based analysis<br>of  real plants . Anomalous scenarios on a rotary plant source  both<br>internally and externally . Internally , time invariant  anomalous (<br>time invariant , or TI , anomalies may also be  referred to as static<br>anomalies ) components in the plant , such  as defective bearings and<br>imbalanced inertia , can lead  amplified vibration or excessive torque<br>application . Anoma  lies also originate from the interaction with the<br>external  environment . For instance , plastic extrusion can lead to a<br>large torsional displacement on the shaft of an injection  molding<br>machine , and normal loads exerted on the drive  shaft of an<br>automobile can lead to significant bending and  vibration . These<br>anomalies take place in two directions , i.e. ,  axially and radially<br>( also referred to as coaxially and  orthogonally , respectively ) .<br>Most operating scenarios , either  normal or anomalous , can be<br>synthesized by commanding  the external torque on the shaft in the<br>axial direction , or  coaxial direction , or the lateral load in the<br>radial direction ,  or orthogonal direction .

On the other hand , for general purpose  database<br>research , it is common to find that popular data  sets , like the<br>anomalous ECG and space shuttle data , has  been explored in multiple<br>studies .  are   [ref: Yeung et al.   2022   Modular, general purpose,<br>automated, anomalous dat] US 2022/0155771 A1  May 19 , 2022  2  a  [<br>0010 ]  In summary , a general purpose benchtop platform  compatible<br>to introduce and label multi modes of anomalies ,  acquire multi<br>variate streams of data , and is conveniently  upgradeable and<br>scalable by non experts can bring practical  benefit to the community<br>.

External forces can also lead to<br>elongation and / or compres  sion of the shaft . Both external torque<br>and forces on the shaft  can lead to plastic or permanent deformation<br>.

The linear stage 54<br>includes a main actuator 56 that is configured to vertically  move an<br>end effector arm 62 of the automatic tool changer  58 via a rotary<br>linear transmission to approach the rotating  shaft 14.

[ 0109 ] The dynamic anomaly<br>generator 30 can be config  ured to generate and process anomalous<br>events via a con  troller 32 , the coaxial anomaly generator 40 , and<br>the  orthogonal anomaly generator 50. In particular , the dynamic<br>anomaly generator 30 can be configured to recognize an  anomalous<br>event that is being synthesized , and subsequently  quantify and<br>record descriptive information regarding the  anomalous event , as<br>well as attributes of the rotatable shaft  14 measured by the data<br>acquisition system 18.

[ 0110<br>]  Specifically , the dynamic anomaly generator 30 can  utilize the<br>recorded data to generate dynamic labels in real  time . Each dynamic<br>label can be included in a time series in  at least one time variant<br>anomaly system , and can be  generated dynamically in real time as the<br>anomalous event  is occurring . Then , for example , if the system<br>were to  transition to a different anomalous event  , the dynamic<br>anomaly generator 30 can be configured to begin recording ,  even<br>instantaneously , event data and generating dynamic  labels for the<br>new anomalous event .

[ 0111<br>] The labels that are generated by the dynamic  anomaly generator 30<br>can include descriptive information  regarding the anomalous event<br>that may be utilized for  supervised learning or machine learning . In<br>particular the  GPASS system 10 can be configured to perform machine<br>learning over time regarding various anomalous events that  occur in<br>the rotational shaft plant . In machine learning , data  set labeling<br>can be a process that includes labeling raw data  with informative<br>details regarding that piece of data . A  machine learning model that<br>uses supervised learning can  require labeled data sets that the model<br>can learn from and  iterate on . Thus , the capability of the dynamic<br>anomaly  generator 30 to generate dynamic labels for the anomalous<br>events can greatly improve the machine learning process .

Still further , the GPAD dataset can be easily<br>scalable and  evolving . Additionally , the anomaly synthesizer can be<br>designed with an expedited automated experimental pipeline  to scale<br>up dataset volume rapidly .  [ 0114 ] As discussed above , the coaxial<br>anomaly generator  40 can simulate rotational damping behavior ( D<br>mode ) by  actively commanding a coaxial motor's 42 resistance to<br>alter  the passive damping torque exerted on the shaft .

In this study, we propose a Rehabilitation In-Pipe<br>Robot (R-IPR) to perform pipe rehabilitation operations and contain<br>induced contamination. The robot features three modules: a pipe<br>cleaning module, a mechanical sealing module, and an in-pipe<br>manipulator module. This study emphasizes the comprehensive design of<br>the mechanical sealing module. We introduce a multi-layer compound<br>structure of the seal to deal with two characteristics of tuberculated<br>pipe surfaces: 1. macroscopical surface roughness, 2. overhang in<br>foundation pro\\ufb01le. The prototype excels in sealing foundation overhang<br>and requires 45% lower compression load than a baseline seal to<br>function. The prototype seal is integrated into the R-IPR. Finally,<br>experiments of the overall system demonstrate the successful<br>performance of the \\ufb01rst contamination-less in-pipe rehabilitation.<br>Keywords: Design Optimization; Compliant Mechanisms; Robotics and<br>Mechanism Systems iros 1 INTRODUCTION Water pipeline maintenance is a<br>severe and global issue.

In developing countries, water loss<br>rates can be up to 40% [2, 3]. Despite the urgency in saving water,<br>the most widely applied method for water pipe rehabilitation is still<br>replacing the entire pipe section after a water-main outburst takes<br>place. Other preventative practices utilize heavy-duty machinery such<br>as mechanical grinders, metal scrappers, and hydro-jets to remove pipe<br>corrosion asperities [4], normally referred to as tubercle. This type<br>of task, categorized as open-cut rehabilitation, is insensitive to<br>potential outbursts, requires complete shut-off of water service, and<br>is largely constrained by the pipe diameter. Rehabilitation In-pipe<br>robots (R-IPR) bring an alternative method to the industry, that is to<br>conduct rehabilitation on the internal surface of pipes. In general, a<br>complete pipe rehabilitation FIGURE 1. A severely corroded water pipe<br>sample from Boston Water and Sewer Commission. The corrosion<br>asperities are called tubercle.

It removes<br>tubercle while moving along the pipeline [6]. The DeWaLop robot by<br>Mateos et al. [7], and the PROKASRO robot [8] each use a multi-DOF in-<br>pipe manipulator and an onboard grinder for the removal task. However,<br>a signi\\ufb01cant concern is ignored by IPR researchers, which is the<br>excessive amount of contamination generated during the rehabilitation<br>process. The harmful byproduct, if not adequately contained, can<br>signi\\ufb01cantly increase the virus content downstream of the pipe network<br>[9] and lead to severe consumer health issues [10]. Unfortunately, to<br>the author\\u2019s knowledge, no existing R-IPR has taken into account the<br>contamination concern. Correspondingly, we propose the Contamination-<br>Less Rehabilitation (CLR) In-Pipe Robot. The robot accomplishes two<br>tasks: conduct in-pipe rehabilitation and contain induced<br>contamination. The most critical onboard component is a mechanical<br>sealing module, whose primary objective is to create a complete<br>enclosure on corroded pipe surfaces. Such surfaces possess two<br>challenges for a seal, namely, macroscopical roughness and foundation<br>overhang. Existing seals, including o-rings, gaskets and suction cups,<br>are not designed for such surfaces, and cannot be deployed on the CLR<br>Robot. To directly address the challenge, we propose a novel compound<br>mechanical seal. It consists of a\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2021 - Design of a Mechanical Sealing Device for Robotic .pdf\",0,1,\"surfaces, and cannot be deployed on the CLR Robot. To directly address<br>the challenge, we propose a novel compound mechanical seal. It<br>consists of a hyper-elastic contact layer (HCL) with an optimized<br>cross-sectional geometry to manage the direct contact with<br>macroscopically-rough surfaces, and a discrete suspension layer (DSL)<br>to accommodate the foundation overhang. This paper centers on the<br>comprehensive design process of the mechanical seal. Sec.2 describes<br>the essential functional requirements (FR) of the CLR Robot, and its<br>projection on the sealing module. In Sec.3, the generalized design and<br>optimization procedure of the hyper-elastic contact layer is<br>presented, followed by the detailed design and considerations for the<br>discrete suspension layer. Prototypes are fabricated and evaluated in<br>Sec.4. Last but not least, in Sec.5, the seal is integrated as a<br>module of the CLR Robot and deployed for the \\ufb01rst contaminationless<br>in-pipe rehabilitation for a corroded pipe. 2 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT<br>The Contamination-Less Rehabilitation In-Pipe Robot is a continuation<br>of the In-Pipe Robot series developed by the MIT Mechatronics Research<br>Laboratory (MRL). Locomotion and pipe-pro\\ufb01le inspection IPRs are<br>presented in the previous studies [11, 12]. Therefore, it is assumed<br>that the CLR Robot is facilitated by the locomotion and inspection<br>robots, such that mechanical stiffness of the robot body and exact<br>location of tubercle asperities are excluded from the scope of<br>consideration.

The pipe cleaning module and<br>sealing module are carried and operated by the manipulator.<br>distribution pipes while containing by-produced contamination. Three<br>sub-tasks are involved, that is, tubercle removal, contamination<br>containment, and end-effector deployment. Correspondingly, we propose<br>the combination of a pipe cleaning module, a mechanical sealing<br>module, and an in-pipe manipulation module. The manipulator operates<br>the cleaning device and the mechanical seal, and the seal physically<br>encompasses the cleaning device at all times, as depicted in Fig.2.<br>The rehabilitation routine schemes as follows: 1. The manipulator<br>engages the seal by compression against the corroded pipe wall to form<br>a water-tight enclosure around the cleaning device. 2. While<br>maintaining the enclosure, the manipulator operates the cleaning<br>device to remove the tubercle asperities within the enclosure, and the<br>introduced contamination is contained in the seal. 3. An external \\ufb02uid<br>pump circulates rinsing \\ufb02uid within the enclosure and collects the<br>contamination. 4.

Further, we discuss in detail the design and optimization<br>process of each component, along with the comparison with commercially<br>available mechanical seals. More speci\\ufb01cally, we present the problem<br>formulation, analytical modeling, virtual simulation and physical<br>experiment. 3.1 Module Description There are two main challenges upon<br>sealing a corroded pipe surface. First is its macroscopical surface<br>roughness. The proposed solution to this challenge is a hyper-elastic<br>contact\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2021 - Design of a Mechanical Sealing Device for Robotic .pdf\",0,2,\"main challenges upon sealing a corroded pipe surface. First is its<br>macroscopical surface roughness. The proposed solution to this<br>challenge is a hyper-elastic contact layer, as displayed in Fig.3. The<br>layer adopts a piece of silicon material with an optimized cross-<br>section. It is in charge of the direct contact with the macroscopic<br>peaks and valleys on the pipe surface. Change in pipe pro\\ufb01le is<br>another critical concern. A sealing module relies only on the hyper-<br>elastic contact layer could fail when the tubercle grows on a<br>foundation overhang, for example, an extrusion at a pipe joint.<br>Correspondingly, a discrete suspension layer is integrated as an<br>auxiliary layer. It serves as a \\ufb02oating support for the hyper-elastic<br>layer. In the case of a foundation overhang, it localizes the affected<br>region and maintains the functionality of the entire module. The<br>discrete suspension layer is installed on a support base, which serves<br>as a mounting portal with the in-pipe manipulator. 3.2 Hyper-elastic<br>Contact Layer 3.2.1 Limits of Existing Seals Heat seal and induction<br>seal are common types of static seal. However, they require special<br>machinery and are limited in the application scenario, and are thus<br>not considered in this study. The face seal is another subset of<br>static seals. A face seal is placed between two mating parts. Under<br>compression, the seal \\ufb01lls the irregularities on the mating surfaces<br>and prevents \\ufb02uid from trespassing.

The leak tests are<br>conducted at six different locations on the substrate, as shown in<br>Fig.13-C. More speci\\ufb01cally, at location 3,4 and 5, there are step<br>overhangs underneath the tuberculated surface, simulating a real-world<br>condition. The experimental result is concluded in Fig.15. At location<br>3,4 and 5, Prototype 3 is the only operable specimen that creates<br>seals for all tests. In contrast, neither Prototype 1 nor 2 can create<br>a seal, due to the lack of a discrete suspension layer.

It consists of three<br>major modules: a pipe cleaning module, a mechanical sealing module,<br>and an inpipe manipulator module. This study emphasizes the<br>comprehensive design of the mechanical sealing module. In particular,<br>we proposed the multi-layer compound structure that comprises of: a<br>hyper-elastic contact layer to seal the tuberculated pipe surface<br>directly, and a discrete-suspension layer to overcome foundation<br>overhang under the tubercle. The compound sealing device is the \\ufb01rst<br>of its kind that successfully address the two challenges. For each<br>layer, we present a thorough design\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2021 - Design of a Mechanical Sealing Device for Robotic .pdf\",0,9,\"compound sealing device is the \\ufb01rst of its kind that successfully<br>address the two challenges. For each layer, we present a thorough<br>design analysis and optimization process. In addition, a grooving<br>method to reduce the compression load is discovered and validated. The<br>sealing module is implemented and proved to be superior to regular<br>seals through multiple evaluations. Eventually, a fully functional CLR<br>Robot is successfully deployed in a corroded pipe environment. In the<br>current R-IPR community, the CLR Robot is the most compact R-IPR,<br>equipped with one of the highest-DoF in-pipe manipulators. The design<br>process leads to some topics that worth exploring in the future. For<br>example, in Sec.3, we present a hypothesis on the geometry of the<br>discrete suspension layer and substrate topology. An exact<br>relationship may be found via extensive experiments. Furthermore, in<br>the real-world deployment, the sealing effect is evaluated in a<br>qualitative manner. It will be bene\\ufb01cial to control the deployment<br>environment and gather quantitative data on the sealing effect.<br>REFERENCES [1] Folkman, S., 2018. \\u201cWater Main Break Rates In the USA<br>and Canada: A Comprehensive Study\\u201d. pp. 1\\u201349.

I. INTRODUCTION Water pipeline maintenance is<br>a severe and global issue. In the United States and Canada, more than<br>10% of the distributed water is lost on its way to the consumers, and<br>over 240,000 water main breaks can happen annually [1].\"],[\"Yeung and Youcef-Toumi - 2020 - An In-Pipe Manipulator for Contamination-Less Reha.pdf\",0,0,\"more than 10% of the distributed water is lost on its way to the<br>consumers, and over 240,000 water main breaks can happen annually [1].<br>In developing countries, water loss rates can be up to 40% [2][3].<br>Despite the urgency in saving water, the most widely applied method<br>for water pipe rehabilitation is still replacing the entire pipe<br>section after a water-main outburst takes place. Other preventative<br>practices utilize heavy-duty machinery such as mechanical grinders,<br>metal scrappers, and hydro-jets to remove pipe corrosion asperities<br>[4], normally referred to as tubercle. This type of task, categorized<br>as opencut rehabilitation, is insensitive to potential outbursts,<br>largely constrained by the pipe diameter, and requires a complete<br>shut-off of water service. Rehabilitation in-pipe robots (R-IPR) bring<br>an alternative method to the industry, which is to conduct<br>rehabilitation on the internal surface of pipes. Thinh et al. propose<br>an R-IPR that is equipped with a cleaning disk, which has<br>approximately the same diameter as the pipe.

The DeWaLop robot by Mateos et al. [6], and the<br>PROKASRO robot [7] each use a multi-DoF in-pipe manipulator and an<br>onboard grinder for the corrosion removal task. However, a vital<br>problem is ignored by IPR researchers, which is the excessive amount<br>of contamination generated during the rehabilitation process. The<br>harmful byproduct, if\"],[\"Yeung and Youcef-Toumi - 2020 - An In-Pipe Manipulator for Contamination-Less Reha.pdf\",0,0,\"However, a vital problem is ignored by IPR researchers, which is the<br>excessive amount of contamination generated during the rehabilitation<br>process. The harmful byproduct, if not adequately contained, can<br>signi\\ufb01cantly increase the virus content downstream of the pipe network<br>[8] and lead to severe consumer health issues [9]. Unfortunately, to<br>the author\\u2019s knowledge, no existing R-IPR has taken into account the<br>contamination concern. Correspondingly, we propose, design and<br>implement the Contamination-Less Rehabilitation (CLR) in-pipe robot to<br>accomplish the following tasks: 1) Conduct general in-pipe<br>rehabilitation. 2) Meanwhile, prevent by-produced debris from<br>contaminating the pipeline. While pipe rehabilitation typically<br>requires multiple operations, namely, pipe-wall cleaning of tubercle,<br>leak site repair, and post-treatment of anti-corrosion layer [10], in<br>this work, the objective narrows down to deliver the pipe-wall<br>cleaning task, since it is often the most intense operation in terms<br>of byproduct generation. The most critical on-board component is an<br>in-pipe manipulator. Its objective is to deploy a specialized<br>mechanical seal [11] to create a water-tight enclosure against<br>corroded pipe surfaces and manipulate a cleaning device to remove<br>tubercle within the enclosure so that no induced debris contaminates<br>the pipeline. This requires the in-pipe manipulator to embody a high<br>degree-of-freedom (DoF) layout, and sets of complex mechanism to<br>decouple the manipulation of the seal and the cleaning device. On the<br>other hand, the in-pipe environment is exceedingly constricted.<br>Notably, in this work, the desFig. 3.

II. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS The Contamination-<br>Less Rehabilitation in-pipe robot is a continuation of the IPR series<br>from the MIT Mechatronics Research Laboratory (MRL). With the MRL<br>locomotion robot (L-IPR) [12], it is presumed that in the cylindrical<br>coordinate of a water distribution pipe, Or,\\u03b8,z, the CLR robot can be<br>grounded at arbitrary positions along the pipeline, i.e., z-axis, and<br>is always centered at the geometric center of the pipe\\u2019s cross-<br>section, i.e., r = 0. In addition, with the MRL inspection IPR (I-IPR)<br>[13], the pro\\ufb01les of local tubercle asperities are assumed as prior<br>knowledge. The integration of the L-IPR, I-IPR, and CLR robot is<br>beyond the scope of this study. The overall objective is to develop an<br>in-pipe device to perform a pipe-cleaning task for corroded water<br>distribution pipes while containing by-produced contamination. Three<br>sub-tasks are involved: pipe surface cleaning, contamination<br>containment, and end-effector manipulation. After rounds of careful<br>screening, we determine to use an electric grinder, a mechanical seal,<br>and an in-pipe manipulator to address the three sub-tasks,<br>respectively. Further demonstrated in Fig.2-D, the seal physically<br>encompasses the electric grinder at all times, and both end-effectors<br>are installed on the manipulator. The rehabilitation routine schemes<br>as follows: 1) The manipulator engages the seal by compression against<br>the corroded pipe wall to form a water-tight enclosure around the<br>cleaning device. 2) The manipulator operates the cleaning device,<br>i.e., the electric grinder, to remove the tubercle asperities, while<br>maintaining the water-tight enclosure. 3) An\"],[\"Yeung and Youcef-Toumi - 2020 - An In-Pipe Manipulator for Contamination-Less Reha.pdf\",0,1,\"cleaning device. 2) The manipulator operates the cleaning device,<br>i.e., the electric grinder, to remove the tubercle asperities, while<br>maintaining the water-tight enclosure. 3) An external \\ufb02uid pump<br>circulates rinsing water through the enclosure and collects contained<br>debris. 4) The manipulator disengages the seal and repeats procedure<br>1) 3) at the next corrosion site.

In addition, the targeted deployment<br>scenario is a 100mm diameter pipe. This is a critical requirement but<br>is not especially emphasized because the proposed design methodology<br>is expected to be scalable across a wide range of deployment<br>scenarios. III. SYSTEM-LEVEL DESIGN In this section, we demonstrate a<br>step-by-step systemlevel design process of the CLR robot, from<br>potential con\\ufb01guration candidates to the \\ufb01nal kinematic layout. Since<br>the Contamination-Less Rehabilitation concept is proposed for the \\ufb01rst<br>time, we believe that detailing the design and validation process is<br>bene\\ufb01cial and heuristic to the general IPR community. Unlike most<br>industrial robots at factory plants, which are barely constrained by<br>the environment, IPRs are specially regulated by the cylindrical<br>geometry of a pipe.

The prevailing<br>R-IPR con\\ufb01guration is demonstrated in Fig.2-C. It utilizes a closed-<br>loop kinematics chain, more speci\\ufb01cally, a set of parallelogram<br>linkage is integrated on the second revolute joint to linearize the<br>revolute motion, keeping the end-effector constantly normal to the<br>pipe surface. Referred to as RR \\u2212 C in this study, this con\\ufb01guration<br>is adopted by most commercial R-IPRs, including the PROKASRO robot [7]<br>and the KA-TE robot [15]. The above con\\ufb01gurations are suitable for<br>tubercle-removal tasks, but no measure is taken to prevent a large<br>amount of by-produced debris from contaminating the pipeline during<br>the rehabilitation operation, making the deployment of such R-IPRs<br>risky and impractical. Other manipulator con\\ufb01gurations that aim at<br>retaining high DoF while minimizing sizes, such as micro tendon-driven<br>manipulators [16] and spherical parallel manipulators [17], also<br>inspire the generation of many design concepts, the representative<br>ones are displayed in Fig.3. 1.

Mounting interfaces for the seal and the inner manipulator<br>are integrated into the frame of Link-2 at A-5 and A-6, respectively.<br>As the seal is mounted rigidly on Link-2, its position, psl,i, can be<br>expressed with the Denavit\\u2013Hartenberg (DH) parameters listed in Table,<br>II, where the displacement of Joint-i is denoted as qi. The position<br>of the seal with respect to coordinate frame O2\\u2032 is given as: psl,2\\u2032 =<br>[5, 0, 20]T [mm] (1) The rehabilitation operation involves a high<br>degree of interaction between two rigid bodies, i.e., the robot and<br>the pipe wall, which can pose potential hazards to the robot\\u2019s<br>hardware. A passive yet effective solution is to use a Serial Elastic<br>Actuator (SEA) is a passive and ef\\ufb01cient way to address this problem<br>[18]. As demonstrated in Fig.6-A-2, a torsional spring is used as the<br>coupling between Joint2 and Link-2. In principle, it serves as a<br>mechanical low pass \\ufb01lter that attenuates high-frequency vibration<br>induced from the pipe-cleaning operation. The installation is modular,<br>more precisely, the spring can be replaced for upgrade or maintenance<br>without disassembling any other component. Since high-speed<br>manipulation is not a critical requirement for the rehabilitation<br>operation, the fact that SEA lowers the system bandwidth is not a<br>particular concern.

The manipulation routine after the seal is in<br>place is proposed as follows: 1) While the seal is engaged by the<br>outer manipulator: a) Turn on the electric grinder. b) Extraction and<br>retraction of the electric grinder along the r-direction to remove<br>tubercle. c) Turn off the electric grinder. d) Manipulate the electric<br>grinder along the zdirection to reach the next asperity. e) Repeat<br>a)-c) until all tubercle asperities in the workspace are cleared. 2)<br>Outer manipulator manipulates both end-effectors to the next angular<br>position, \\u03b8 and radial position, r. 3) Repeat 1) and 2) until<br>breakpoint. 6393 Authorized licensed use limited to: MIT Libraries.<br>Downloaded on April 19,2023 at 05:55:44 UTC from IEEE Xplore.<br>Restrictions apply.

Thus, Joint-3 utilizes a pair of lead-<br>screw type transmission, indicated by Fig.7-1. Joint-4 practices<br>routine 1-d. Since the grinder is not in contact with any tubercle<br>asperity at this step, the load requirement for Joint-4 is not<br>considerable. Consequently, a rack-and-pinion transmission is adopted<br>for its quick response and trivial complexity, as shown in Fig.75.<br>Additionally, two pairs of sliding rails and linear bearings are<br>employed for each of Joint 3 and 4 to avoid incidental deformation<br>during operation. The DH parameters for i = 3, 4 are de\\ufb01ned in<br>Table.III. The position of the cleaning device with respect to<br>coordinate frame O4 is: pcln,4 = [0, \\u221217 + q4, Lbit]T [mm] (2) where<br>Lbit is the length of the grinding bit. It is worth emphasizing that<br>the tubercle-removal routine is meticulously planned as multiple<br>orthogonal grindings along the z-axis. An alternative routine is to<br>conduct facegrinding along the z-axis without retracting the cleaning<br>bit. To accomplish this alternative, a high-payload transmission and a<br>high-precision gantry system are needed for Joint 4.

HARDWARE FABRICATION AND INTEGRATION In this<br>section, we implement the \\ufb01nalized CLR robot design. Particularly, we<br>present the process of material selection, component fabrication, and<br>system integration in detail. In a concurrent work, we propose a<br>compound mechanical seal for the CLR robot. It features a multi-layer<br>compound structure to deal with two characteristics of tuberculated<br>pipe surfaces: 1. macroscopical surface roughness, 2. overhang in<br>foundation pro\\ufb01le. The mechanical seal requires a 45% lower<br>compression load than off-the-shelf seals to function [11].<br>Speci\\ufb01cally, the mechanical seal requires less than 90N/m unit force<br>to create a water-tight enclosure on mildly corroded pipe surfaces<br>with tubercle asperities up to 4mm tall. The circumference along the<br>center-line of the seal is 212mm. For the tubercle removal task, a<br>2300RPM-1.1W-DC motor is used to power a 3mm-diameter grinding bits.<br>Unfortunately, no reference is found on the load requirement to<br>demolish a piece of tubercle asperity. Consequently, a bench-top<br>experiment is conducted to determine the practical load requirement,<br>as displayed in Fig.8. The grinder setup is attached to a press bench,<br>which thrust the grinder into a piece of corroded sample. It is<br>recorded that a maximum pressing force of 8N is suf\\ufb01cient to<br>completely remove 4mm tall tubercle asperity in the worst case, i.e.,<br>from a heavily corroded pipe surface. Fig. 8.

The grinding bit<br>successfully reaches the pipe surface when the manipulator is grounded<br>at the geometric center of the pipe\\u2019s cross-section, i.e., r = 0. In<br>addition, the bit can be retracted by a maximum distance of 8.7mm, to<br>minimize the volume of the CLR robot. The retraction distance is<br>greater than the targeted asperity height, 4mm, as a redundant measure<br>in case of excessively big tubercle. Fig. 11.

The anti-corrosion layer on the pipe section was removed<br>and it was placed in a humid environment for six months. Tubercle<br>asperities that are approximately 3-4mm tall developed on the pipe<br>wall. Shown in Fig.14 is an illustration of the deployment setup. The<br>CLR robot is attached to a \\ufb01xture that simulates a grounded locomotion<br>in-pipe robot. An external circulation device is grounded in adjacent<br>to the L-IPR. It consists of two water pumps and a water storage. The<br>circulation device is connected to the compartment of the mechanical<br>seal. During the rehabilitation process, one pump \\ufb01lls the compartment<br>with rinsing water, and the other pump retrieves the rinsing water<br>into the storage, carrying the\"],[\"Yeung and Youcef-Toumi - 2020 - An In-Pipe Manipulator for Contamination-Less Reha.pdf\",0,6,\"During the rehabilitation process, one pump \\ufb01lls the compartment with<br>rinsing water, and the other pump retrieves the rinsing water into the<br>storage, carrying the by-produced debris. A \\ufb01lter layer is integrated<br>into the storage so that \\ufb01ltered water can be reused for circulation.<br>Fig. 14. Top: Schematics of the deployment setup. Bottom: Illustration<br>of the deployment setup in a clear PVC pipe. The manipulator engages<br>the seal in Fig.15-A. The operator manually manipulates the grinder to<br>remove the tubercle asperities. Since no visual feedback is available<br>on-board, the operator postulates a suf\\ufb01cient removal when the<br>grinding bit is in touch with the metal pipe wall, which can be easily<br>suggested with a sudden increase in noise level. Fig.15-B demonstrates<br>the result of the operation. An approximately 10mm by 15mm corroded<br>area on the pipe surface is cleaned. The circulation device collects<br>the by-produced debris and successfully circulates the rinsing water.<br>At the current stage, a controlled method to evaluate the quantitative<br>effect of contamination containment is yet to be determined. In this<br>work, the effectiveness is suggested in a few ways. First, there is no<br>observable \\ufb02uid leakage from the sealed enclosure during the<br>operation. This can be further validated by the darkened color on the<br>mechanical seal in Fig.15-C,-D, as it indicates a full contact between<br>the seal and the pipe wall. Furthermore, in Fig.14-E, the residual<br>debris on the \\ufb01lter layer of the water storage is displayed.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION In this study, a vital yet ignored<br>aspect of rehabilitation in-pipe robots is identi\\ufb01ed. At present, no<br>state-of-the-art RIPR takes into consideration the by-produced<br>contamination during the operation, which could lead to a detrimental<br>effect on consumer health. Targeting this loophole, we propose the<br>concept of \\u2019Contamination-Less Rehabilitation\\u2019, and the CLR robot,<br>correspondingly. The CLR robot features three modules: a pipe-cleaning<br>grinder, a compound mechanical seal, and an in-pipe manipulator. This<br>work focuses on the manipulator, which features a novel nested-outer-<br>inner manipulator con\\ufb01guration. We present the entire design and<br>validation process in detail, such that the work can be heuristic to<br>the general R-IPR community. The CLR robot presents a novel<br>manipulator layout that satis\\ufb01es the CLR concept.

More speci\\ufb01cally, it is a layout that allows simultaneous<br>operations of two end-effectors, with one\\u2019s workspace fully enclosed<br>by the other endeffector\\u2019s physical volume. We believe this novel<br>mechanism can extend to more than rehabilitation of water distribution<br>pipes. A foreseeable application is on an explosive-diffusing robot.<br>The CLR robot also provides a possible solution to miniaturization of<br>R-IPRs, especially for deployment in sub100mm diameter pipes. It is<br>vital to realize room for improvements to the CLR robot. The real-<br>world deployment result is rather qualitative. The future procedure<br>involves setting up a more controlled environment to identify<br>performance factors for robust design. On the other hand, the current<br>position controller might easily lead to excessive de\\ufb02ection in the<br>mechanical components when the operation is not conducted<br>meticulously. One way to ameliorate this concern is with more advanced<br>control laws such as an impedance controller. Another potential<br>solution is to provide visual feedback to the operator, i.e.,<br>embedding vision in the manipulator. The ultimate goal for this<br>project is to deploy this robot to conduct a Contamination-Less<br>Rehabilitation task in an in-service network.

SUMMARY  FIELD  [ 0002 ] The present disclosure relates to bending<br>angle  sensors and methods for manufacturing the same , and more<br>particularly to such sensors and manufacturing methods that  allow for<br>less precision during the manufacture process  and / or the ability to<br>use larger , low -\"],[\"Youcef-Toumi et al. - 2019 - Bending angle sensors and methods for manufacturin.pdf\",0,6,\"and manufacturing methods that  allow for less precision during the<br>manufacture process  and / or the ability to use larger , low cost<br>sensing elements .  Bending angle sensors can be used across a variety<br>of fields ,  including but not limited to helping detect leaks in<br>pipes .  BACKGROUND  [ 0003 ] Soft material sensors can be useful in a<br>variety of  applications due to their flexibility and robustness . One<br>example of a soft material sensor is a bending angle sensor .  Some<br>conventional bending angle sensors are implemented  as a cantilevered<br>beam that can bend in one or more axial  directions ( e.g. , up or<br>down ) in response to an applied force .  Such sensors can be<br>configured to determine the direction  and magnitude to which the<br>applied force compresses ,  stretches , or bends the sensor ,<br>including the magnitude and  direction of a bending angle .  [ 0004 ]<br>FIG . 1 illustrates a conventional bending angle  sensor 10 that<br>includes a membrane 30 having an embedded  sensing element 50. The<br>membrane 30 is generally made of  a soft rubber or other pliable<br>material that can bend , stretch ,  or compress when an external force<br>is applied . The sensing  element 50 can be configured to measure the<br>strain on the  membrane 30 that corresponds to such bending ,<br>stretching ,  or compressing of\"],[\"Youcef-Toumi et al. - 2019 - Bending angle sensors and methods for manufacturin.pdf\",0,6,\"50 can be configured to measure the strain on the  membrane 30 that<br>corresponds to such bending , stretching ,  or compressing of the<br>membrane .  [ 0005 ] In some instances , the strain can have opposite<br>polarities about a neutral shear axis Ay of the membrane 30 .  For<br>example , as shown in FIG . 1 , when a downward external  force F is<br>applied on the cantilevered membrane 30 , the  strain is generally a<br>positive or tensile strain St on the side  above the neutral shear<br>axis Ay and a negative or compres  sive strain 5 ' on the opposing<br>side below the neutral shear  axis . Conversely , when an upward<br>external force is applied ,  the strain polarities can be in reverse .<br>The strain along the  neutral shear axis Ay is approximately zero .  [<br>0006 ]  To avoid conflating positive and negative strain  measurements<br>across the neutral shear axis Ay , the sensing  element 50 is<br>typically disposed to one side of the membrane  30 that is either<br>above or below the neutral shear axis Ay . As  shown in FIG . 1 , the<br>neutral shear axis Ay of the membrane  30 is generally coaxial with a<br>central longitudinal axis Ac of  the membrane 30. Thus , the sensing<br>element 50 must have  a thickness 50h that is less than one half of<br>the thickness\"],[\"Youcef-Toumi et al. - 2019 - Bending angle sensors and methods for manufacturin.pdf\",0,6,\" the membrane 30. Thus , the sensing element 50 must have  a thickness<br>50h that is less than one half of the thickness 30h  of the membrane<br>30 .  [ 0007 ] Accordingly , for conventional bending angle sen  sors<br>having a total thickness in the range of about 10  millimeters or less<br>, the sensing element must have a thick  ness of about 5 millimeters<br>or less to operate properly .  Sensing elements of this size , however<br>, are expensive .

[ 0031 ] The present<br>disclosure is targeted to improvements  in the structure and<br>manufacture of bending angle sensors to  reduce cost and time to<br>manufacture . Such sensors can be  used in a variety of different<br>contexts , including but not  limited in conjunction with detecting<br>leaks in a pipe through  which fluid is flowing .  [ 0032 ] As<br>discussed above , in conventional bending angle  sensors , a sensing<br>element is typically disposed on one side  of the central longitudinal<br>axis of a flexible membrane to  avoid conflating sensor measurements<br>across a coaxially  aligned neutral shear axis . This can require the<br>use of  expensive sensing elements that are very thin and require<br>costly manufacturing equipment to properly position them  within the<br>sensor membrane .

The present disclosure<br>allevi  ates those problems , among other benefits , by disposing a<br>stiffer material layer to one side of the membrane , which  causes the<br>neutral shear axis to shift away from the central  longitudinal axis<br>of the membrane . Thus , by shifting the  neutral shear axis to one<br>side of the membrane , bending  angle sensors can be manufactured with<br>larger , less expen  sive sensing elements . Alternatively , or<br>additionally , by  shifting the neutral shear axis to one side of the<br>membrane ,  a sensing element can be embedded within the membrane<br>with less precision by eliminating the requirement that the  sensing<br>element must be disposed on one side of the central  longitudinal axis<br>of the membrane .  [ 0033 ] By way of non limiting example , FIGS . 2A<br>and 2B  illustrate one exemplary embodiment of a bending angle  sensor<br>100. As shown , the sensor 100 can include a mem  brane 130 having a<br>first material layer 170 and a supple  mental second material layer<br>190. A sensing element 150 can  be embedded in the first material<br>layer 170. The second  material layer 190 can be disposed on a surface<br>of the first  material layer 170. In the illustrated embodiment , the<br>second  material layer\"],[\"Youcef-Toumi et al. - 2019 - Bending angle sensors and methods for manufacturin.pdf\",0,8,\"layer 190 can be disposed on a surface of the first  material layer<br>170. In the illustrated embodiment , the second  material layer 190 is<br>disposed on an exterior surface 172 of  the first material layer 170 ,<br>e.g. , facing the source of an  expected force F. Alternatively , in<br>some embodiments , the  second material layer 190 can be disposed on<br>an exterior  surface 174 of the first material layer 170 , e.g. ,<br>facing away  from the source of an expected force F. Although the<br>membrane 130 is shown as having a rectangular shape , the  membrane<br>can be configured or adapted to have other  geometrical shapes .  [<br>0034 ] To shift the neutral shear axis Ay ' of the membrane  130 away<br>from the central longitudinal axis Ac  ' of the first  material layer<br>170 , the second material layer 190 can be  configured to have a<br>stiffness that is greater than a stiffness  of the first material<br>layer 170. For example , the addition of  a stiffer second material<br>layer can shift the neutral shear axis  An ' of the membrane 130 to a<br>location between the central  longitudinal axis Ac of the first<br>material layer 170 and a  central longitudinal axis Ac \\\" of the second<br>material layer  190.

As shown in FIG . 2B , the neutral<br>shear axis Ax ' of the  membrane 130 can correspond to a longitudinal<br>plane within  the membrane .  [ 0035 ] The specific location of the<br>neutral shear axis Ax '  of the membrane 130 can depend , at least in<br>part , on a ratio  of the stiffness of the second material layer 190<br>relative to  the stiffness of the first material layer 170. For<br>example , as  shown in FIG . 2A , the neutral shear axis Ay ' can be<br>located  at or in close proximity to the interface 130i between the<br>first  material layer 170 and the second material layer 190 by<br>configuring the second material layer 190 to have a stiffness  that is<br>greater than the stiffness of the first material layer 170  by a<br>factor of approximately two ( 2 ) or more . In some  embodiments , the<br>stiffness of the second material layer 190  can depend on the<br>thickness and constituent material ( s ) of  the layer . In some<br>embodiments , the second material layer  190 can have a stiffness that<br>is not dependent on the  thickness of the layer .

In some  embodiments ,<br>the neutral shear axis Ax ' can be in close  proximity to the<br>interface 130i between the first material  layer 170 and the second<br>material layer 190 when the neutral  shear axis is located at an<br>approximate distance away from  the interface approximately in a range<br>of about 0 millimeters  to about one half ( 50 % ) of the thickness of<br>the sensor 100 .  [ 0036 ] In some embodiments , Young's modulus can<br>be  used as a measure of the stiffness of the first material layer<br>170 and the second material layer 190. For example , in some<br>embodiments , a ratio of Young's modulus for the second  material<br>layer 190 relative to Young's modulus for the first  material layer<br>170 can be approximately equal to two ( 2 ) . In  some embodiments ,<br>the ratio can be more than two . In some  embodiments , Young's<br>modulus of the first material layer  170 can be approximately in the<br>range between about 0.001  Gigapascal ( GPa ) to about 0.05 GPa .

In some embodiments ,  Young's<br>modulus of the second material layer 190 can be  approximately in the<br>range between about 0.001 Gigapascal  ( GPa ) to about 0.1 GPa . For<br>example , in some certain  embodiments , Young's modulus of the first<br>material layer  170 can be approximately 0.005 GPa and Young's modulus<br>of the second material layer 190 can be approximately 0.01  GPa . A<br>person skilled in the art will recognize that other  measurements or<br>techniques can be used to determine the  stiffness of the respective<br>material layers , such as but not  limited to elasticity and Shore<br>hardness .

Each of the bending angle sensors 1100 can include<br>a membrane 1130 having a first material layer 1170 and a  supplemental<br>second material layer 1190.

The support structure 1010 can include<br>support arms or shafts 1012 that extend radially from a  common hub<br>1014. When a fluid flows in the pipe 1500 , the  fluid flow may push<br>the support structure 1010 such that the  radially extending support<br>arms 1012 expand and thereby  maintain contact with the inner wall of<br>the pipe 1500 as the  system 1000 moves through the pipe . Conversely<br>, when the  system 1000 encounters an obstacle ( e.g. , pipe diameter<br>reduction ) , the obstacle and / or a fluid flow may push down  on one<br>or more the radially extending support arms 1012 ,  thereby<br>compressing the support structure 1010. Each of the  bending angle<br>sensors 1100 can be cantilevered from the  terminal ends 1016 of the<br>radially extending support arms  1012 , thereby positioning each<br>sensor membrane 1130 adja  cent to an inner wall of a pipe 1500. Each<br>sensor membrane  1130 can be configured to bend , stretch , or<br>compress in  response to a force on the membrane .

As discussed above with respect  to FIGS . 2A 4<br>, the second material layer 1190 can be  configured to have a<br>stiffness that is greater than a stiffness  of the first material<br>layer 1170 to shift the neutral shear axis  AN \\\" of the membrane 1130<br>away from the central longitu  dinal axis AC  ' \\\" of the first<br>material layer 1170.

For example , when the<br>membrane 1130 encounters a  leak 1502 in the wall of the pipe 1500 ,<br>the pressure gradient  at the source of the leak can create a suction<br>force that bends  the membrane 1130 into contact with the inner wall<br>of the  pipe . As the system 1000 continues to move in an axial<br>direction of the fluid flow ( e.g. , left to right in FIG . 5 ) , the<br>friction force of the inner wall pulls against the membrane  1130 ,<br>causing strain on the membrane that can be detected  by the sensing<br>element 1150 .

SENSING<br>METHODOLOGY Metamaterial sensing is a popular methodology in recent<br>studies. MTMs are arti\\ufb01cially made electromagnetic materials<br>consisting of periodically arranged metallic elements, whose sizes are<br>less than the wavelength of the incident electromagnetic (EM) wave<br>[2]. These materials exhibit exotic electromagnetic properties which<br>are not readily available in nature, such as reverse Doppler and<br>Vavilov-Cerenkov effect [3], negative refraction [4], [5],<br>diffraction-limit breaking imaging [6]\\u2013[9] and cloaking [10]. Multiple<br>studies examine the usage of MTM for sensing purposes. For example,<br>[11] numerically and experimentally demonstrates a tunable MTM<br>absorber. The absorber composes arti\\ufb01cial dielectric atoms arrayed<br>periodically in a background matrix\"],[\"Alshehri et al. - 2021 - Radio-Frequency-Based Resonating Sensor for Condit.pdf\",0,0,\"sensing purposes. For example, [11] numerically and experimentally<br>demonstrates a tunable MTM absorber. The absorber composes arti\\ufb01cial<br>dielectric atoms arrayed periodically in a background matrix on a<br>metallic plate to serve as both a resonant and a tunable unit.<br>Additionally, in [11], a simple structured MTM model is investigated<br>with potential applications for condition monitoring sensors and<br>frequency selective devices. In this study, we propose an elastic RF-<br>MTM sensor. Elasticity in structure and a novel sensing mechanism are<br>the key features in the proposed RF-MTM sensor. The proposed MTM<br>sensors are directly attached to the shaft surface using thin textured<br>layers. Defects are identi\\ufb01ed by monitoring the change in return loss<br>magnitude and frequency shift introduced by the local deformations on<br>the shaft surface. III. PHYSICAL MODELLING The analytical modeling of<br>a deformed MTM unit cell is derived. The shaft experiences generalized<br>force inputs, which mechanically deform the geometry of the MTM unit<br>cell that is directly bonded to the surface of the shaft, which<br>further deviates its electrical properties. An RF signal analyzer<br>captures the RF signals that transmit through and re\\ufb02ect from a unit<br>cell. Depending on the extent of change in the electrical properties,<br>the captured RF signals can differ drastically. A. Unit Cell Geometry<br>A split-ring resonator (SRR) unit cell is studied. As demonstrated in<br>Fig.1-A, the unit cell consists of N = 2 MTM rings that are bonded to<br>a conductive substrate.

MOTIVATION AND BACKGROUND A popular practice for data-<br>driven anomaly prognostics is to synthesize the anomalous events on a<br>specialized plant. Real-world anomalous data are rare, especially on<br>physical machines, due to the sparsity of naturally occurred anomalous<br>events and data con\\ufb01dentiality from commercial entities. The general<br>data synthesis process involves the followings: at one time step, the<br>control variables U \\u2208 Rn\\u00d71 are commanded inputs to a physical plant<br>and the states X \\u2208 Rm\\u00d71 are updated accordingly. Via a perception<br>system, the states are measured as output signals Y \\u2208 Rp\\u00d71. There are<br>few shortcomings in existing anomaly synthesizers. The most signi\\ufb01cant<br>one is the inability to introduce dynamic anomalies. Static anomalies<br>typically include replacing quality parts with defective ones or<br>operating under bad service conditions. Examples include the test rigs<br>constructed in [1][2][3] to simulate off-centered or damaged ball<br>bearings and misaligned-rotors. The anomalous plant varies between<br>runs but is time-invariant or negligibly variant during each run. A<br>synthesizer for generic dynamic anomalies is lacking, and inevitably,<br>so are the labels of the synthesized anomalies. The uni-modality of<br>anomalous events is also a signi\\ufb01cant inconvenience. To the authors\\u2019<br>knowledge, most existing synthesizer testbeds, such as in [4][5][6],<br>are developed for speci\\ufb01c types of anomalies. Even on the same<br>subject, researchers have to develop new devices to introduce<br>anomalies of other varieties. From the data acquisition perspective,<br>measurements in available anomalous data sets, for example, the\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2021 - A General-Purpose Anomalous Scenario Synthesizer f.pdf\",0,0,\"have to develop new devices to introduce anomalies of other varieties.<br>From the data acquisition perspective, measurements in available<br>anomalous data sets, for example, the anomalous ECG and space-shuttle<br>data [7] that are widely used in anomaly prognostics studies<br>[8][9][10], are univariate or multi-variate with low dimensions.<br>Access to multi-variate measurements on the same anomalous event is<br>tangibly useful for data-driven studies.

In Section<br>II, we lay out the system-level development for general-purpose<br>anomaly synthesizers. More details on the different sub-systems are<br>discussed in Section III.

The contribution and<br>future works of the GPASS are discussed in Section VI. II. SYSTEM-<br>LEVEL DEVELOPMENT A. Basic Components This section presents the<br>development of the GPASS from a system-level perspective. An anomalous<br>data synthesizer should include three basic sub-systems: the test<br>plant, a perception system, and an anomaly generation system. The<br>perception system covers the measurements, Y , of the test plant in<br>multiple domains and record the control inputs, U , that introduce the<br>anomalies. For general-purposes, the anomaly generation system should<br>be able to generate an extensive range of anomalous modes that<br>frequently take place in similar plants. In particular, the GPASS is<br>developed for plants actuated by rotation, the most widely-applied<br>actuation mechanism in machines. B. Common Anomalous Scenarios<br>Anomalous scenarios on a rotary plant source both internally and<br>externally. Internally, time-invariant components in the plant, such<br>as defective bearings and imbalanced inertia, can lead to ampli\\ufb01ed<br>vibration or excessive torque application. Anomalies also originate<br>from the interaction with the external environment. For instance,<br>plastic extrusion can lead to a large torsional displacement on the<br>shaft\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2021 - A General-Purpose Anomalous Scenario Synthesizer f.pdf\",0,1,\"application. Anomalies also originate from the interaction with the<br>external environment. For instance, plastic extrusion can lead to a<br>large torsional displacement on the shaft of an injection-molding<br>machine, and normal loads exerted on the drive-shaft of an automobile<br>can lead to signi\\ufb01cant bending and vibration. In principle, these<br>anomalies take place in two directions, i.e., axially and radially.<br>Most operating scenarios, either normal or anomalous, can be<br>synthesized by commanding the external torque on the shaft in the<br>axial direction or the lateral load in the radial direction. C.<br>Realization in the GPASS System The GPASS system realizes axial and<br>radial inputs on the rotary plant with two separate devices. An<br>overview of the GPASS system is shown in Fig.1, which illustrates its<br>mechanical layout. It includes the rotary plant, a wireless sensor<br>package, an Axial Anomaly Generator (AAG) and a Radial Anomaly<br>Generator (RAG). Both devices can generate an extensive range of<br>dynamic and modular anomalies, meaning that the commanded inputs are<br>time-variant, and the basic anomalous modes can be synergized to<br>simulate more complex anomalies. Without loss of generality, in the<br>following sections, we present in detail the AAG\\u2019s methodologies to<br>introduce rotational damping to the shaft and the methodologies of the<br>RAG to synthesize bending and active vibration to the shaft as the<br>basic anomalous modes. The test plant and the wireless sensor package<br>are the two other essential components of the GPASS system.

To<br>conveniently set up defective parts as static anomalies, the test<br>plant is designed with particular modularity. The GPASS system\\u2019s<br>perception is streamed mostly from the novel wireless sensor package<br>that was developed in our previous work [11]. It is installed on the<br>shaft to probe the condition of multi-variate signals at a high<br>sampling rate. In addition, self-perception elements are integrated<br>into both the AAG and the RAG to quantify and record the anomalies<br>that are introduced to the rotary shaft plant.

DYNAMIC ANOMALY GENERATOR DEVELOPMENT A. Axial Anomaly<br>Generator In the axial direction, most dynamic anomalies can be<br>synthesized by commanding an external torque applied to the shaft.<br>More speci\\ufb01cally, we identify rotational stiffness and rotational<br>damping as two fundamental sources of external torque. The former<br>usually takes place in the joints of robotic manipulators. The latter<br>normally happens in plants that interact with a viscous environment,<br>such as in injectionmolding machines or on ships\\u2019 rotors. Both<br>scenarios are synthesized electrically in the AAG. As shown in Fig.1,<br>in spite of the driving motor that actuates the shaft, there is an<br>anomaly generating motor connected to the other end of the shaft to<br>provide the external torque. For rotational stiffness and damping, the<br>torque can be commanded as virtual springs or dampers with an active<br>controller using the relationships of\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2021 - A General-Purpose Anomalous Scenario Synthesizer f.pdf\",0,1,\"external torque.

Radial Anomaly 1)<br>Fundamental Anomalous Modes: We identify the lateral load as the main<br>cause of deformation in the radial direction of the shaft, as<br>mentioned in Section II. We further break up lateral loading into two<br>modes: (i) large and constant shear load, which routinely occurs in<br>vehicle drive-trains and robotic applications that result in bending<br>deformation; (ii) high-frequency vibratory load, which can be observed<br>in almost any dynamic application. The two modes are denoted as N-mode<br>and V-mode, respectively. 2) Functional Requirement: The RAG must meet<br>some quantitative and\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2021 - A General-Purpose Anomalous Scenario Synthesizer f.pdf\",0,2,\"in almost any dynamic application. The two modes are denoted as N-mode<br>and V-mode, respectively. 2) Functional Requirement: The RAG must meet<br>some quantitative and qualitative functional requirements. We identify<br>and list the critical ones in what follows. Quantitatively, the RAG<br>must suf\\ufb01ce considerable ranges for the dynamic inputs. In the N-mode,<br>the most important input is the magnitude of the lateral force. For<br>the Vmode, the active vibration frequency is a signi\\ufb01cant dynamic<br>input. The RAG\\u2019s authority to control these inputs in realtime is<br>essential. Qualitatively, when it is idle, the RAG cannot interfere<br>with the rotary shaft\\u2019s normal operation. Suf\\ufb01ciently-high level of<br>modularity to easily extend the scope of anomalous scenarios is<br>critical for the RAG. In addition, it has to deliver consistent inputs<br>regardless of the shafts\\u2019 objective properties, including the<br>materials and the geometries. Last but not least, protective elements<br>is to be integrated into the RAG to avoid hardware damage if any<br>contact between the RAG and the rotary shaft is necessary. 3) Input<br>Constraints: In the following, we compile quantitative engineering<br>constraints when introducing the N-mode and the V-mode to a rotating<br>shaft. The N-mode\\u2019s goal is to produce bending deformation with a<br>controlled lateral force. The force Fn can be equivalently transformed<br>to a moment load via force-moment analyses. As illustrated in Fig.2,<br>when the shaft is static and homogeneous, the governing equation of<br>the shaft under bending moment can be approximated on the basis of the<br>Euler-Bernoulli (EB) beam equation: EIzz \\u22024xd(xn) \\u2202x4n =\"],[\"Yeung et al. - 2021 - A General-Purpose Anomalous Scenario Synthesizer f.pdf\",0,2,\"the governing equation of the shaft under bending moment can be<br>approximated on the basis of the Euler-Bernoulli (EB) beam equation:<br>EIzz \\u22024xd(xn) \\u2202x4n = EIzz \\u03c1 = Mz(xn) (4) The strain on the surface of<br>the shaft is approximated with: \\u03f5s = rs \\u03c1 (5) \\ud835\\udc40\\ud835\\udc67 \\ud835\\udc5f\\ud835\\udc60 \\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc51 \\ud835\\udc39\\ud835\\udc5b \\ud835\\udc65\\ud835\\udc5b Fig. 2.<br>Euler-Bernoulli beam model for the shaft under static condition. The<br>surface strain cannot saturate the maximum sensing range of onboard<br>strain-gauge sensors if any. Additionally, the commanded lateral force<br>cannot exceed the rated force output of the RAG actuator. The<br>constraints for the N-mode are thus: \\u03f5s < \\u03f5max,sg; Fn < Fa (6) In<br>principle, the active frequencies components cannot coincide with the<br>setup\\u2019s hardware frequencies to avoid incidental excitation. When a<br>rotating shaft is under deformation, a signi\\ufb01cant phenomenon is the<br>ampli\\ufb01cation of vibratory components at the multiples of the shaft\\u2019s<br>angular velocity \\u03c9r[12]. The other active frequency is \\u03c9a in the<br>V-mode. The operator directly commands both active frequencies during<br>syntheses as inputs. The passive hardware frequencies include the<br>shaft\\u2019s natural frequency, \\u03c9s, which is a property of the shaft and<br>its boundary conditions. It can be approximated via \\ufb01nite element<br>analysis or with the EB beam model.

Rotation of the shaft<br>exerts distributed centrifugal forces that affect the natural<br>frequencies. However, it has been reported in [13] and demonstrated in<br>[14] that the effect is trivial for ordinary shafts with normal<br>rotational speed. The bandwidth of the setup, \\u03c9e, is the other<br>hardware frequency and is discussed in detail in the following sub-<br>section. To avoid collision between frequencies and to leave for a<br>safety boundary, the GPASS system is regulated with: 3\\u03c9r, \\u03c9a <<br>0.9min(\\u03c9e, \\u03c9s) (8) unless the purpose is to introduce resonance to the<br>shaft. Furthermore, aliasing is prevented by another set of<br>constraints imposed on the active frequencies: max(3\\u03c9r, \\u03c9a) < 0.5\\u03c9wss<br>(9) 4) Detailed Hardware Design: We present now the hardware and<br>software designs of the RAG in the GPASS system in detail. The setup<br>is used to illustrate the design methodologies mentioned previously<br>but is not the only solution. The qualitative functional requirements<br>affect the synthesis routine and the mechanical architecture of the<br>RAG. To ensure minimal interference with the rotary shaft, the RAG is<br>installed on the plant\\u2019s exterior. During operation, a slider arm<br>carries an end-effector tool head to approach the rotating shaft, as<br>shown in Fig.3-C.

The bandwidth of<br>the suspension can be conveniently altered by installing compression<br>springs with different stiffnesses. The scope of anomalous modes can<br>be extended by simply installing a new piece of the end-effector tool<br>head. We propose a novel device that is installed on the shaft to<br>standardize the synthesis processes. As shown in Fig.35\\u20dd, during<br>operation, the physical inputs from the end-effector tool heads are<br>delivered to this device instead of directly to the shaft to ensure<br>consistent deliveries across various shaft materials or geometries.<br>Annotated as the remote receptor, this device receives physical inputs<br>in both contact and contactless forms.

The discussion<br>focuses on sensor data streams that are the most representative to<br>support the work. For instance, Fig.9 demonstrates 6 out of the 28<br>real-time sensor signals that captures an unexpected power drop at t \\u2248<br>10s during testing. Furthermore, we conduct discrete Fourier<br>transforms (DFT) on selected sensor data and demonstrate that even<br>preliminary analyses possess great potentials for identifying<br>anomalies in the system. A. Normal Force: N-mode In the \\ufb01rst synthesis<br>routine, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the N-mode. We exert a<br>dynamically-updating force trajectory Fn,ref(t) via the contact method<br>on a shaft rotating at \\u03c9r = 200RPM = 3.3Hz. The reference trajectory<br>and the actual force readings during the synthesis process are shown<br>in Fig.10. Good force tracking capability of the proposed feedback<br>control loop is demonstrated.

In<br>the United States and Canada, there is an approximately 10% loss due<br>to pipeline\"],[\"Yeung - 2019 - Design of a robotic water-pipe rehabilitation.pdf\",0,16,\"significant losses in natural and human resources around the world. In<br>the United States and Canada, there is an approximately 10% loss due<br>to pipeline leakage before water reaches its consumer, and over<br>240,000 water mains break per year. In developing countries, water<br>loss rate can be up to 40% [1][2][3]. The world spends trillions of<br>dollars annually for water pipe maintenance and compensating leaked<br>water. Under such pressing conditions lie great opportunities in water<br>pipeline rehabilitation and protection. The two major failures faced<br>by water pipelines are pipe leakage and tubercles. Both problems can<br>be traced down to corrosion [4]. The corrosion process first starts<br>with the attachment of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria onto pipe wall<br>[5]. The anaerobic bacteria need to build a shelter to block oxygen,<br>thus reduction-oxidation reaction takes place on the pipe wall. The<br>reaction slowly removes elements from the pipe wall and builds<br>shelters around the bacteria. At the anode site, these shelters<br>eventually become tubercle. At the cathode site, as more elements are<br>taken, the thickness of the pipe wall decreases and eventually leads<br>to a leak. In some extraordinary cases, more than 50% of pipe diameter<br>can be obstructed by tubercles. Although tubercles have negligible<br>impact on consumer health, they significantly reduce flow rate, place<br>an extra burden on water station and increase the risk of water pipe<br>outburst. 17  [ref: Yeung   2019   Design of a robotic water pipe<br>rehabilitation] Although water pipeline failure is a tremendous issue<br>worldwide, rehabilitation of water pipes seems to be a neglected area.\"],[\"Yeung - 2019 - Design of a robotic water-pipe rehabilitation.pdf\",0,17,\"  2019   Design of a robotic water pipe rehabilitation] Although water<br>pipeline failure is a tremendous issue worldwide, rehabilitation of<br>water pipes seems to be a neglected area.  Contrary to the blooming<br>technology developments in robotics, artificial intelligence and<br>Internet of Things, the most commonly used pipe rehabilitation<br>'technology' is still digging out and replacing the entire pipe. Such<br>conventional methods are extremely labor-intensive, usually including<br>an extensive amount of manpower in digging and setting up temporary<br>pipelines. Water service needs to be shut down and neighborhood around<br>the area end up with muddy flood everywhere. Such situations make<br>technology development in water pipe rehabilitation a must. 1.2<br>Background of Water Pipe Rehabilitation 1.2.1  Rehabilitation Process<br>There are three steps for a successful pipe rehabilitation job. They<br>are removing tubercles, fixing leakage and post-treatment. No matter<br>the rehabilitation is performed by a human or a robot, the process<br>still entails the exact three steps, unless the entire pipe is<br>replaced. First, tubercle along the pipe, or at least, at the vicinity<br>of leaks should be removed. This process is normally called 'pigging'.<br>The goal of pigging is to provide clear access to the device or<br>adhesive that is going to be used to fix the leak. For pipes with<br>larger diameters, workers are sent in to remove the tubercle. Faster<br>and more efficient pigging techniques include mechanical pigging, ice-<br>pigging and metal-scrapping the entire pipeline. The second and third<br>steps are fixing the leak and doing the post-treatment. The goal is to<br>get rid\"],[\"Yeung - 2019 - Design of a robotic water-pipe rehabilitation.pdf\",0,17,\"ice-pigging and metal-scrapping the entire pipeline. The second and<br>third steps are fixing the leak and doing the post-treatment. The goal<br>is to get rid of any leak along the pipeline and prevent future<br>corrosion from reoccurring. Aside from replacing the entire pipe, Nu-<br>Flow [6] and UV curing repair are the latest technologies into<br>pipeline rehabilitation. Corrosion resistant chemicals or UV adhesives<br>are blown along the pipe wall to seal leaks after the pigging process.<br>Without sufficient post-processing of pipe wall, tubercles and leaks<br>are likely to return in a more intense manner. 18  [ref: Yeung   2019<br>Design of a robotic water pipe rehabilitation] 1.2.2  Robotic In-Pipe<br>Solution In-pipe robots (IPR) provide an alternative solution to pipe<br>rehabilitation. Comparing to conventional rehabilitation techniques,<br>robotic solutions possess advantages in all aspects. First, the<br>covered pipe.length for a single rehabilitation job is increased.<br>Previously, even with trenchless repair techniques such as UV curing<br>and Nu-Flow, only a few meters of pipes can be repaired in a single<br>run. With untethered robots in pipe network, hundreds of meters of<br>pipes can be repaired with a single deployment. Additionally, in-pipe<br>robots can reduce human labor to a minimal amount. Another advantage<br>of in-pipe robots is that they can focus on local defects along the<br>pipeline. In case when there's only one 2mm pinhole leak along a 5m<br>pipe, IPRs are able to repair only the leak site while conventional<br>methods need to repair a much larger portion of the pipe, wasting time<br>and resource.

In the near future, swarms of<br>IPRs can form pipeline networks. The entire water pipe system can be<br>built into an ecosystem.

Such a huge potential shifts the focus of numerous<br>research labs and companies towards In-Pipe Robots (IPR). Saga et al.<br>[8] proposed an IPR with inchworm driving mechanism. Kakogawa et al.<br>[9] developed a crawler IPR that utilizes underactuated 19  [ref:<br>Yeung   2019   Design of a robotic water pipe rehabilitation] four-bar<br>linkage to overcome obstacles. Pratama et al. [101 designed an<br>automatic wheeled driving robot using fuzzy control logic to fit<br>various pipe diameters. Nayak et al. [11] put focus on pipeline<br>inspection. Chatzigeorgious et al. [12] proposed reliable sensing<br>techniques inside pipelines. Most of these works focus on the<br>locomotion and sensing modules of IPR. Despite the prosperity in<br>locomotion module and pipeadaptation module of In-pipe Robots, few are<br>designed for pipe rehabilitation. Wu et al. [7] designed a passive in-<br>pipe leak sensor that utilizes a\"],[\"Yeung - 2019 - Design of a robotic water-pipe rehabilitation.pdf\",0,19,\"pipeadaptation module of In-pipe Robots, few are designed for pipe<br>rehabilitation. Wu et al. [7] designed a passive in-pipe leak sensor<br>that utilizes a suction force, caused by a pressure gradient at the<br>vicinity of the leak, as shown in Fig.1-1. This concept provides a<br>possibility for future research direction. On the commercial side, KA-<br>TE [13] developed a series of intelligent robot that repairs pipe<br>joints with Ultraviolet (UV) adhesives. ProKarso [14] proposed a 2<br>Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) manipulator installed on a locomotion module<br>that is able to remove obstructions with a Direct Current (DC) motor<br>driven grinder, demonstrated in Fig.1-2. Such robots are by far the<br>most advanced ones in pipe rehabilitating. Figure 1-2: The Karso<br>Working robot contains a 2-DOF manipulator and a DC motor grinder<br>[14]. In-pipe robot is a promising pathway for water pipe<br>rehabilitation, yet quite a few challenges exist. Pipe size is one of<br>the challenges. Even as advanced as KA-TE and ProKarso, neither robot<br>targets small pipes, i.e, pipes under 100mm in diameter, which are<br>very common in urban pipe networks. The absence of IPR dealing with<br>small diameter pipes is caused by the complexity of arranging multiple<br>actuators compactly while maintaining maneuverability. Another<br>consideration lies in the contamination made by IPRs during the<br>tubercle removal process. IPR tubercle removal process generates a<br>huge amount of particles and chemical waste. It is crucial for 20<br>[ref: Yeung   2019   Design of a robotic water pipe rehabilitation]<br>IPRs to contain all contamination so that they are able to operate<br>with the pipeline\"],[\"Yeung - 2019 - Design of a robotic water-pipe rehabilitation.pdf\",0,19,\"crucial for 20  [ref: Yeung   2019   Design of a robotic water pipe<br>rehabilitation] IPRs to contain all contamination so that they are<br>able to operate with the pipeline in service. To the author's<br>knowledge, there hasn't been any effort made in this area. Other<br>challenges include communication, power consumption and localization<br>[15]. 1.3  Thesis Outline In this study, the Minimal Particle<br>Contamination Obstruction Removal system (MPCOR) is designed and<br>implemented. This is a major sub-system of the Mechatronics Research<br>Laboratory (MRL) pipe rehabilitation robot. There are two major<br>breakthroughs in this robot. First, it is the first IPR that takes<br>care of particle contamination during the pipe rehabilitation process<br>and it is, in fact, one of the few pioneering pipe rehabilitation<br>robots. Second, it is the first high-DOF rehabilitation robot that can<br>operate in pipes under 100mm diameter. The MRL pipe rehabilitation<br>robot is designed to be deployed in both in-service and dry pipelines.<br>As mentioned previously, an important function required for IPR to<br>operate in such pipelines is to be able to contain the contamination<br>generated by tubercle removal. The designed robot carries a Compliant<br>Surface Adaptation Module (CSAM) to create a completely enclosed<br>volume on tuberculated pipe walls to collect all the debris. It<br>combines optimized geometries and mechanical components to minimize<br>actuator burden to seal corroded pipe surface and is the pioneering<br>device in such application. The main body of the MPCOR is a<br>Manipulation Module(MM). The challenge is due to the confined in-pipe<br>environment.

The challenge is<br>due to the confined in-pipe environment. Most IPRs either have a very<br>limited workspace, low Degree-of-Freedom or can only operate in large<br>diameter pipes. The study presents an arrangement for a 4-DOF<br>manipulator that can operate in 102mm diameter pipes. This manipulator<br>also includes an integrated spindle for tubercle removal process. This<br>robot is also highly modularized to satisfy the needs of various<br>tasks.

Chapter 7 summarizes this<br>thesis and provides recommendations for future work. 22  [ref: Yeung<br>2019   Design of a robotic water pipe rehabilitation] Chapter 2 System<br>Overview In this chapter, we provide an overview of the of MRL pipe<br>rehabilitation robot. In Sec.2.1, the system layout of the robot is<br>presented. In Sec.2.2, the robot working procedure is described. 2.1<br>Proposed System Layout A successful pipe rehabilitation task involves<br>three steps, removing tubercle, fixing leak and post-treatment. To<br>accomplish this, MRL pipe rehabilitation robot contains at least four<br>sub-systems, a Locomotion system, a Leak and Obstruction Detection<br>system, a Minimal Particle Contamination Obstruction Removal system<br>and a Leak Repair system.

The overall functionality of each<br>sub-system is presented in Fig.2-1. In the beginning, the robot<br>patrols along the water pipe with its Locomotion system. Its Leak and<br>Obstruction Detection system alerts the operator with the existence of<br>a leak. Information such as surrounding tubercle height, leak location<br>and size are recorded or sent to the operator. The Locomotion system<br>embraces the robot rigidly to the pipe wall. After this step, the<br>rehabilitation process takes place. Minimal Particle Contamination<br>Obstruction Removal system is first activated.

The MRL robot is a pipe rehabilitation<br>robot designed to work in both in-service and dry water pipes. As a<br>first step towards in-pipe robotic rehabilitation, this study focuses<br>on the dry deployment scenario. However, during the design process,<br>the limitation of in-service deployment is considered and space for<br>future mechanical upgrades is held. The difference between the two<br>working environments lies in the debris collection sequence. In both<br>scenarios, the debris should be flushed out of the pipe through the<br>leak site. For a dry environment, the robot carries an appropriate<br>flushing system. After the tubercle is completely removed, a water<br>pump rinses the sealed environment and flush out the debris. In case<br>the robot is operating in an in-service water pipe, a water valve is<br>used to control the flushing process. The complexity lies in water-<br>proofing electronics and high power requirement to fight against water<br>pressure. 2.2  Design and Work-flow The MPCOR system includes a<br>Compliant Surface Adaptation Module, discussed in Chapter 3 and 4 and<br>a Manipulation Module, presented in Chapter 5.

The major components for each module are<br>described and the coordination between the two modules is illustrated.<br>The detailed designs are contained in Chapters 3, 4 and 5. 26  [ref:<br>Yeung   2019   Design of a robotic water pipe rehabilitation] Chapter<br>3 Compliant Surface Adaptation Module Design There are two critical<br>modules for the MPCOR. The Manipulation Module operates an end-<br>effector to clean off any obstructions at the vicinity of the pipe<br>leak. During this process, the Compliant Surface Adaptation Module<br>encloses a watertight surrounding for the spindle to prevent any<br>debris from falling out and contaminating the pipeline. In this<br>chapter, the Compliant Surface Adaptation Module is introduced. It is<br>designed to minimize force requirement. Modeling and theoretical<br>analysis of CSAM components are introduced. Step-by-step guidance for<br>future designers is also presented. 3.1  Background of seals In this<br>section, we briefly review the sealing device that is currently used<br>in human activities. Reviewing state-of-the-art seals facilitate<br>understanding why these seals cannot function in the CSAM application<br>and reveal the importance of CSAM. Seals can be divided into two main<br>categories, dynamic seals, normally referred to as mechanical seals,<br>and static seals. Different types of dynamic seals are presented along<br>with current static seals. 27  [ref: Yeung   2019   Design of a<br>robotic water pipe rehabilitation] 3.1.1  Dynamic Seal Dynamic seals<br>are sealing\"],[\"Yeung - 2019 - Design of a robotic water-pipe rehabilitation.pdf\",0,26,\"seals are presented along with current static seals. 27  [ref: Yeung<br>2019   Design of a robotic water pipe rehabilitation] 3.1.1  Dynamic<br>Seal Dynamic seals are sealing devices that are installed on machines<br>to prevent leak when two mating parts are in reciprocal or rotational<br>motion. Depending on its arrangement, there are pusher/non-pusher,<br>hydrodynamic/hydrostatic, balanced/unbalanced and single-spring/multi-<br>spring type. They are commonly used on the shaft of fluid pumps. Sal<br>1br leod,g Seal (oflower Mal Sprin  Rer Figure 3-1: Demonstration of a<br>dynamic seal [16]. Dynamic seals consist of two major components, a<br>primary seal that is used to seal the relative motion and secondary<br>seals such as o-rings to seal the components of the primary seal. For<br>example, on a water pump, the primary seal is made up of a rotor that<br>rotates with the shaft and a stator that is fixed on the pump body.<br>The two parts are pressed against each other with different spring<br>arrangements. The major challenge for dynamic seals is to seal the<br>mating surface between the rotor and the stator while maintaining<br>enough lubrication. Both sealing and lubricating are either achieved<br>by filling the mating gap with working fluid or specialized sealing<br>liquid. The secondary seals are static seals. O-rings are used in<br>almost every case. Obviously, the primary seal is not applicable in<br>CSAM application because there is no relative motion once the<br>manipulators are in place. The only applicable reference for CSAM is<br>the static seal. 28  [ref: Yeung   2019   Design of a robotic water<br>pipe rehabilitation] 3.1.2  Static\"],[\"Yeung - 2019 - Design of a robotic water-pipe rehabilitation.pdf\",0,27,\"manipulators are in place. The only applicable reference for CSAM is<br>the static seal. 28  [ref: Yeung   2019   Design of a robotic water<br>pipe rehabilitation] 3.1.2  Static Seal Static seals possess many<br>forms. Heat seal and induction seal are used in production lines to<br>wrap products. These seals include special types of machinery and<br>application scenarios are very limited. Face seal is the most common<br>type of static seal. Gaskets and o-rings both belong to this category.<br>This type of seals is placed in between two mating parts. Under<br>compression, the seal fills in the irregularities on the mating<br>surfaces and prevent fluid or gas leakage. A common application is<br>head gaskets in car engines.

The two keywords of face seals are<br>compression and rough surface. This is very similar to the MPCOR<br>application.

In the CSAM application, the thickness of the sealing device<br>can be no more than 2 3cm. With tubercle height in mm or cm, this<br>means that the sealing device needs to endure extreme strain.

Based on the deployment<br>scenario, it should be highly deformable when it is pressed against a<br>rough pipe surface. More specifically, the CSAM should be able to<br>operate inside 101mm (4-in) diameter corroded water pipe. The maximum<br>obstruction height CSAM can accommodate should be at least 5mm.

The<br>design should be scalable for water pipes with various diameters. 3.3<br>Design Overview The finalized design of CSAM consists of three<br>components, an elastic cushion, a compression spring suspension, and a<br>supporting base, as shown in Fig.3-5. When it 30  [ref: Yeung   2019<br>Design of a robotic water pipe rehabilitation] A* Figure 3-3: Severely<br>corroded water pipe section obtained from Boston Sewer and Water<br>Commission. is pressed against a pipe wall under applied pressing<br>force, the cushion is in direct contact with the tubercle and the<br>compression spring assembly act as a floating support for the cushion.<br>The entire design is optimized so that the minimum applied pressing<br>force is needed for the CSAM to create a completely sealed<br>environment. 3.4  Modelling and Analysis 3.4.1  Objective and Review<br>The objective of the CSAM is to optimize the cross-sectional shape of<br>the silicone cushion and design of compression spring suspension so<br>that it can create a fully\"],[\"Yeung - 2019 - Design of a robotic water-pipe rehabilitation.pdf\",0,30,\"the CSAM is to optimize the cross-sectional shape of the silicone<br>cushion and design of compression spring suspension so that it can<br>create a fully enclosed environment on the pipe wall with minimal<br>pressing power.

We first investigate and optimize the silicone cross-section,<br>then the effect of compression spring suspension is analyzed. 31<br>[ref: Yeung   2019   Design of a robotic water pipe rehabilitation]<br>Figure 3-4: Final design of CSAM. 3.4.2  Silicone Cross-section<br>Optimization Surface Contact Mechanisms Sealing rough surfaces with<br>elastic components, such as o-ring and gaskets, is one of the most<br>common applications in hardware design. However, despite its<br>popularity, theoretical analysis of o-rings and gaskets are not<br>broadly studied. The sealing application can be categorized as a<br>surface contact problem. Surface contact theories describe<br>analytically the deformation of a surface when it's pressed against a<br>substrate. Quite a few contact theories have been developed since the<br>1 9 th century. The pioneering work is done by H.Hertz in 1880s [18],<br>in which he described the contact between 'flat' surfaces as contacts<br>between very small elastic solids with parabolic shapes. The work is<br>based on the assumption that these solids are spherical bumps with<br>equal radius. Greenwood and William published the first rough surface<br>contact model in 1966 [19], in which the elastic solids are modeled<br>with equal radii and at different heights. Starting from 1975 [20],<br>more advanced multi-asperity contact theories are studied. A widely<br>used model is the Bush, Gibson, and\"],[\"Yeung - 2019 - Design of a robotic water-pipe rehabilitation.pdf\",0,31,\"and at different heights. Starting from 1975 [20], more advanced<br>multi-asperity contact theories are studied. A widely used model is<br>the Bush, Gibson, and Thomas (BGT) model, which considers asperities<br>at various length scales. Despite the abundance of contact theories,<br>few are applicable to this study. All mentioned contact theories are<br>suitable for 'machined' surface, where there's no macroscopic bumps or<br>dents. In water pipes, the condition is not similar. Simply observing<br>the corroded water pipe wall, it can be seen that tubercles have<br>arbitrary 32  [ref: Yeung   2019   Design of a robotic water pipe<br>rehabilitation] Figure 3-5: Exploded view of CSAM.

Nonetheless, a novel contact<br>mechanics being developed by Persson [21][22][231 since 2000s serves<br>as a good reference for this study. Persson did not approach the<br>surface contact problem by assuming the shape of the asperities,<br>instead, he looked at the overall surface roughness power spectrum<br>density (PSD). The advantage of utilizing the power spectrum density<br>is that the PSD does not assume the shape of the substrate a priori.<br>In addition, it not only evaluates the vertical difference of a rough<br>surface, but also the horizontal distribution of height difference<br>[24]. Some important details of Persson's Contact Theory are presented<br>in Appendix.A.

In this sub-section, we present dimensionless analysis for<br>this relationship. HMaterial Property: E Pa  P. Figure 3-6:<br>Demonstration of CSAM application. Corroded water pipe walls have<br>randomly distributed height and shape at different length scale, the<br>most scientific and widely-applied method to describe the surface is<br>through power spectrum C(q), where q is the roughness wavevector [25].<br>It is very similar to the power spectrum density widely applied in<br>signal processing, where the power for each frequency is calculated<br>using Fourier Transform. In a 2-D space, the wavevector space is<br>denoted as q  (q2, qy) and q =  g2 + q2.

The two values do not have<br>defined physical meanings, but one can interpret that a greater # or<br>smaller uo represents a rougher surface. Calculating # and uo is very<br>complicated and the equations are attached in Appendix.A. The last<br>important parameter for the surface roughness is the maximum peak-<br>valley height difference of hmax. The information of hma, is indeed<br>contained in C(q). However, it is treated as an independent parameter<br>due to its importance and trivial dependence with # and uO. Now that<br>the information from the substrate is extracted, the silicone<br>properties are investigated. For the Compliant Surface Adaptation<br>Module, the designed silicone rubber block has a rectangular cross-<br>section with a height of H and thickness of T. The penetration of<br>rubber block into the substrate is given the term w, as shown in<br>Fig.3-6. Assume that the selected silicone has a compression modulus E<br>and Poisson's ratio v.

Since the silicone<br>cushion is rigidly bonded to the base, i.e., no slip relative to the<br>base. Under this condition, the effective modulus is dependent upon<br>shape factor S [29][30], which is determined by the dimension of the<br>rubber block. Gent and Lindley [31] introduced the equations to<br>approximate apparent Young's modulus 35  [ref: Yeung   2019   Design<br>of a robotic water pipe rehabilitation] Ea for compression of bonded<br>rubber blocks Ea = E( + 4S2)  (3.2) 3  3 for infinitely long rubber<br>blocks. Shape factor can be calculated with S =  where T is the rubber<br>width and H is the rubber height. The shape factor is derived as the<br>ratio of loaded surface area over force-free area. For cylindrical<br>disks, the apparent Young's modulus is approximated with Ea = E(1 + 2S<br>2 )  (3.3) where S  =  and r is the cylinder radius. An extra term<br>effective shape factor Se = Ea/E is defined as a more straightforward<br>expression. In conclusion, we have eight independent parameters to<br>evaluate the applied compression pressure Pa; for surface roughness,<br>three parameters, 3, uo and hmax; for the silicone geometry, H and T,<br>the cross-section; for silicone material, the compression modulus E<br>and Poisson's ratio v; and the silicone's penetration w in to<br>substrate. Dimensional Analysis Due to the massive amount of<br>independent variables, it is clearer and more convenient to express<br>the relationship in a group of dimensionless terms, i.e., Buckingham's<br>II groups.

It is a common approach in fluid mechanics to express<br>complex terms in a compact and economic form. Furthermore, relating<br>dimensionless parameters expedites scaling laws especially in this<br>study when various designs are compared. Persson [27][28] derived an<br>explicit expression pE(U) =  a 2 e u/uo  (3.4) 1ev where u is the<br>separation between silicone's bottom surface and deepest point of 36<br>[ref: Yeung   2019   Design of a robotic water pipe rehabilitation]<br>the substrate when silicone is compressed into the substrate. The<br>applied force is Fa = PaA  (3.5) where A is the area in contact with<br>the substrate. Eqn.(A.2) can be further derived into a more intuitive<br>form with penetration as an input, as shown in Eqn.(3.6). Here, the<br>bonding effect is also accounted for.

In Fig.3-8 and Fig.3-9, this is directly<br>reflected as a lower value of 11 . In a real-world scenario, the<br>substrate surface roughness is given, meaning that the designer cannot<br>optimize 112 and 113Thus, setting up the best 14 and 15 is of top<br>priority. In the CSAM application, the rectangular silicone cross-<br>section contains a groove that divides the cross-section in the<br>thickness direction, as shown in Fig.3-10. Adding the groove helps to<br>reduce the value of 114 while keeping 115 constant. In consequence, H<br>value is lowered. More technically speaking, adding the groove reduces<br>the effect of traverse shear stress in the thickness direction, thus<br>lowers the value of shape factor and apparent compression modulus. As<br>demonstrated in Fig.3-11, adding one bisecting groove lowers 1 from<br>0.075, red dot, to 0.056, green dot, while maintaining all other<br>parameters the same.

The second constraint is the silicone<br>material. For applied compression pressure to be as low as possible,<br>the selected silicone material should possess a low compression<br>modulus E. Meanwhile, there is an important consideration for 116, the<br>aspect ratio of the crosssection. For hyperelastic materials such as<br>silicone, the structural rigidity should be considered. As illustrated<br>in Fig.3-12, each wall of the silicone cushion can be modeled as a<br>thin-plate with thickness T, lengths H and L. The critical buckling<br>stress is proportional to f2 and buckling coefficient k, which has a<br>positive correlation with .

In<br>summary, the overall objective is to minimize the applied compression<br>pressure. Several constraints should be imposed by designers.

On the other hand, the PSD for<br>the combined region A+B can be defined as C,. However, C, does not<br>contain the cor42  [ref: Yeung   2019   Design of a robotic water pipe<br>rehabilitation] rect surface roughness information because it is an<br>averaged roughness calculation over both regions A and B and it's<br>statistically inappropriate to be applied.

As mentioned in<br>Sec.3.4.3, the design parameters of the compression springs are<br>constrained by hardware dimensions. Once pipe height difference 6h is<br>specified, the performance of compression spring suspension is only<br>dependant on the spring stiffness k,,p,ig and the length of silicone<br>each spring is supporting, L,. To determine the two values, the<br>hardware constraints are listed. The selected push rod has 3mm<br>diameter and 12mm length.

To provide enough space for the<br>reciprocal motion of push rod and retaining ring, L, is set to be<br>9.8mm. On the other hand, at the joint 55  [ref: Yeung   2019   Design<br>of a robotic water pipe rehabilitation] section of a 102mm diameter<br>pipe, there is a typical profile change of 6h = 2.5mm.

The length of spring cannot<br>exceed 8mm or MPCOR would be too bulky to operate in the corroded<br>pipe. In conclusion, the compression spring needs to satisfy the<br>following dimensions: 2.5mm < L,,,in, 8mm, 3mm < dspring < 9.5mm.<br>Eventually, a 7mm in length and 6mm in diameter spring with stiffness<br>k,pring =0.068N/mm is selected. 4.3  Fabrication The fabricated CSAM<br>is shown in Fig.4-12. The silicone used in the experiments, Ecoflex<br>00-30 is used for the fabrication. The interior of the silicone<br>chamber has 78mm and 49mm length and width and is modified to fit the<br>curvature of the pipe wall. The silicone is injected into a 3d-printed<br>female mold and placed in 65\\u00b0C(150\\u00b0F) for 20 minutes to cure. There<br>are 26 compression springs in total. The silicone base and spring<br>bases are 3d-printed. With this design, referring back to Fig.4-6, an<br>applied force of 3.28N is sufficient to create a complete seal.

Second, set the silicone material. This provides<br>the designer with a fixed compression modulus E. The next step is to<br>experimentally determine the aspect ratio (thickness/ height) range of<br>the cross-section for the selected silicone. Based on components<br>dimensional constraint,\"],[\"Yeung - 2019 - Design of a robotic water-pipe rehabilitation.pdf\",0,56,\"The next step is to experimentally determine the aspect ratio<br>(thickness/ height) range of the cross-section for the selected<br>silicone. Based on components dimensional constraint, determine the<br>cross-section thickness and height. This step determines 114 and 15<br>for the design and thus 111 can be extracted from the dimensionless rI<br>groups analysis. To further lower H 1, add a groove to the<br>crosssection while ensuring the aspect ratio does not fall out the<br>experimentally determined range. The required applied pressure can<br>thus be determined by multiplying 111 by E. The selection of<br>compression spring depends on dimensional constraints. Given length<br>and spring radius, select the spring with lowest stiffness and length<br>greater than 6h that is available. With the silicone and compression<br>spring design finalized, the compression force for the CSAM<br>application can be calculated with Eqn.(3.5) and Eqn.(3.9). This<br>compression force is the minimum force to guarantee the full<br>functionality of CSAM. 4.5  Chapter Summary In this chapter, we<br>simulate a 3d-printed rough substrate.

Without enough reference, a bench-top experiment is<br>conducted to determine this force, as shown in Fig.4-10. To drill<br>through and collapse an area of tubercle, the maximum 64 mi  [ref:<br>Yeung   2019   Design of a robotic water pipe rehabilitation] force<br>needed is 9.6N.

As shown in Fig.6-3, a 3d-printed<br>tubercle board is made. It has the same profile as the simulated<br>substrate used for the experiment in Sec.3.4.2.

The strain energy function for<br>5-parameter MR is given with Eqn.B.1, IF = Cio (13) +Coi (I2-3)+Cl(-11<br>--3)(12-3)+C20(I1-3)2 +C02 (123)2 + I(j-1)2 (B.1) where C10,C0<br>1,C20,C0 2 and C11 are the material constants; I1 and 12 are the<br>deviatoric first and second principal invariant; d is the<br>incompressibility parameter and J is the Jacobian. Static structural<br>Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is conducted in ANSYS to validate the<br>feasibility of the concept. As illustrated in Fig.B-1, the tubercle is<br>represented by an arbitrarily shaped surface and the silicone rubber<br>is represented by an 8 x 8 x 10mm cuboid. The surface contact is set<br>to be bonded. The bottom of the silicone rubber is fixed. A 0.iN<br>pressing force is constantly applied to the -y-direction. For this<br>simulation, the MR parameters are set as C10 = -3.20kPa, 85  [ref:<br>Yeung   2019   Design of a robotic water pipe rehabilitation] Total<br>Dforman 2 Type: Total Deform~ton Lhit mm 209/2/28 1713 2.5193 2.2044<br>lAWS 1.5746 12596 0.94473 0.62982 0.1491 Figure B-1: FEA of<br>hyperelastic material pressed by tubercle is conducted to test<br>feasibility of silicone deforming over rough surface.
