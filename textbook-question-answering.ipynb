For example, a customer support chatbot may need to provide answers to common questions. The GPT models have picked up a lot of general knowledge in training, but we often need to ingest and use a large library of more specific information.\n","\n","In this notebook we will demonstrate a method for enabling GPT-3 able to answer questions using a library of text as a reference, by using document embeddings and retrieval. For this example, a textbook was chunked up into text blocks and sorted according to the chapter where it came from and will be the main focus for this example.

Third, the system operation should resemble a conventional AFM system but be more user friendly. The proper alignment of the laser spot and probe tip plays an important role for successful AFM imaging. This is often a time-consuming task that demands signiﬁcant experience with the instrument. The handling of small size passive probes can also be intimidating to novice users especially with the delicate and expensive nature of the probes. For an educational environment, it would be ideal to reduce experiment overhead and avoid equipment damage due to operational mistakes on a fundamental design level. Therefore, the system design should be more user friendly to reduce experiment overhead. High power electronics should also be avoided to ensure safety of novice users. Fourth, the AFM should be designed with a number of experiments that can be run on the individual subsystems. During the learning process, it is important to 11.3 Low Cost AFM Scanner 335 make connections between the theoretical models and the experimental results. As an AFM platform designed for educational purpose, corresponding lab experiments designed with each subsystem can help the students to further their understanding of the instrument. With these four design principles, the active probe based educational AFM system is proposed. The AFM subsystems including scanner, electronics, engagement sys- tem and data acquisition modules are introduced individually followed by the system integration for AFM imaging.
